The rise of slavery in the Americas... Why Africans?

### Key Questions

- Why Africans? What were the conditions that led to Africans being the primary source of slave labor between 1500-1850?
- How did Europeans come to adopt common attitudes toward African enslavement?

Our main focus this week would be on the second question, and it involves the study of racial attitudes toward the Africans. Arguments around this particular question are polarized - some argued that racism existed *before* the slave trades, while the others argued otherwise. However, we would also come to know that there was a significant change in the concepts and practices of racism over time...

### Africans in the Islamic World

As many of the slaves went across the Sahara Desert and the Atlantic Ocean, and even some of those originated from the Eastern coast of Africa, via the Northern borders of the Africa continent and Gulf of Persia. It is worth noting that the slave trades in the East happened *earlier*, in the 8th century. Most of the early African slaves were sent to North Africa and the Middle East.

In the Middle East, distinctions started to emerge in Islamic societites - those called *Mamluks* (European slaves, usually "worths more" in ransom, often assigned lighter labour), and *Abids* (African slaves, often assigned heavier labour). Zanj (referring to East Africa) Revolt (9th century) - East Africans slaves in Iraq revolt and nearly overthrow the Abbasid Caliphate.

By the 11th century, nearly 11,000 slaves were in Bahrain (contemporary Iraq).

*"I have not described the country of African blacks and the other people of the torrid zone: because naturally loving wisdom, ingenuity, religion, justice, and regular government, how could I notice such people as these, or magnify them by inserting an account of their countries."*

â€” Ibn Haukal, ca. 10th century.

### Islam and slavery in the Iberian Peninsula

By the mid-8th century, the Iberian Peninsula (consists of contemporary Spain and Portugal) was completely controlled by Muslims - where they brought in the ideas of Africa, and their slaves to the location.

Also imported were racial characterisations based on climates...

Said al-Andalusi wrote ca. 11th century, in his *Book of the Categories of Nations*, *"For those peoples... who live near and beyond the equinoctal line to the limit of the inhabited world in the south, the long presence of the sun at the zenith makes the air hot and the atmosphere thin. Because of this, their temperants become hot and their humours fiery, their color black and their hair woolly. Thus they lack self control and steadiness of mind and are overcome by fickleness, foolishness, and ignorance..."*

Ibn Battuta, when in Mali in 1352, writes that there was *"no good to be expected from them"*.

From Ibn Khaldun ca. 14th century, *"the Negro nations are, as a rule, submissive to slavery, because [Negroes] have little that is [essentially] human and possess attributes that are quite similar to those of dumb animals"*.

#### In essence...

If Muslims cultivated early forms of racism, Iberians and then other Europeans *perfected* them. As Christians, they had an idea that they, the African slaves was associated with the *Curse of Ham* from the Bible, for them practiced those prohibited, was damned to servitude.

Continuing development fo the idea that black Africans were equated to slaves.

### Jews and Africans: Overlapping European Ideologies

Jews were key figures in the kingdoms in Castile, Aragon, and Portugal.

Merchants, bankers, tax collectors. They were known to be hated, but no violence was taken against them until mid-14th century with widespread depression and the plague. Catholics priests placed blame on the Jews, led to the 1391 Spanish pogrom. Many Jews were thus converted to Christianity.

By 1450, Judaism no longer defined so much by belief, as by blood. Negative sentiment against Jews is being closely associated with *"blood purity"* at the same time that Africans begin arriving into the Iberian Peninsula in large numbers. And incidently, the Africans were subjects to identification by blood (Christianity in blood).

*Alleged inferiority of blood could be seen on the body.*

Father Prudencio de Sandoval, historian of King Charles V (1500 - 1558):

*"Who could deny that in the descendants of Jews remains and endures th eevil inclination of their ancient ingratitude and bad knowledge, just as in the negroes the inseparable accident of their blackness? Even if the negros cohabits a thousand times with white women, the children are born with the dark colour of their fathers. Thus, it is not enough for the Jews to be three parts hidalgo, or an Old Christian, since only one race infects and damages them..."*

### Contrast to African ideas of slavery

Unlike (recall) in the African societies, where there was a continuum between being slaves and being part of a kinship, where people could move freely along this continuum. In Europe and the Islamic World, however, there was a rigid distinction between the two concepts, where the other end was *commoners* of a kingdom.

Racism in the Iberian Peninsula would eventually influence to the North, countries like England and France would join the trades - but those motives would be described in more detail in the next lecture.

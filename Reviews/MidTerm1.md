Mid-Term Review (March, 2017)
=============================

Identification Terms
--------------------

### Diaspora

The movement, migration, or scattering of a people away from an established or ancestral homeland.

Diaspora versus Migration: Migration limited in scope and duration, while diaspora involves movement of more peoples to various destinations over a long period of time.

This would *not* be an accurate definition (as referred to "Africans", see Professor Fair's "Idea of Africa" lecture):

- African diasporas occurred in various incidents, but mostly lasted over a long period of time (trade routes, and slave-trades, etc.).
- People living in Africa before the 19th Century did not have a concept of identification that they themselves were "Africans" (clans, tribes, kingdoms) - rather, this is a definition imposed on them by European settlers and explorers.

Africans' diaspora lasted over the period from before slave trade (before the Europeans arrived), Africans were involved in migrations over the Sahara Desert and extensive trade routes to the Middle East and Asian countries (a picture of a giraffe brought to China, and the Arabic slave trade - where *domestic* slaves, mainly women were sold up to the Roman Empire and Arabic nations).

In the 1440s, the first African slaves were brought to Portugal.

### Curse of Ham

- Biblical story and complexion, the curse of Ham - which brought Ham a darker skin complexion (see quote below).
- A theory of African ancestor.
- Used by Europeans to re-inforce the idea of African inferiority.

*If Muslims cultivated early forms of racism, Iberians and then other Europeans perfected them.* As Christians, they had an idea that they, the African slaves were associated with the Curse of Ham from the Bible, for them practiced those prohibited, was damned to servitude.

*"The curse occurs in the Book of Genesis and concerns Noah's drunkenness and the accompanying shameful act perpetrated by his son Ham, the father of Canaan (Gen. 9:20–27). The controversies raised by this story regarding the nature of Ham's transgression, and the question of why Noah cursed Canaan when Ham had sinned, have been debated for over two thousand years."*

*"Some modern scholars have argued that the story's original purpose was to justify the subjection of the Canaanite people to the Israelites, but in later centuries, the narrative was interpreted by some Jews, Christians, and Muslims as an explanation for black skin, as well as slavery. Nevertheless, most Christians, Muslims and Jews now disagree with such interpretations, because in the biblical text, Ham himself is not cursed, and race or skin color is never mentioned."*

### Queen Njinga

Queen of the Kingdom of Ndongo, which Spainish and Portguese (which was unified by the period) attacked in alliance with the Imbangalas... A nation of warriors, known and feared of their cannibalistic practices, initiation rituals, etc.

Queen Njinga was known for her direct diplomatic interactions with the Portuguese since 1622, when she travelled to Luanda, capital of Angola - then a Portuguese settlement - where she remained for several months and was baptised as Ana de Sousa. Before her baptism, she practiced Kimbundu, where rituals were performed to connect to the ancestors - to solve personal and social illnesses, and seasonal issues.

But her power was challenged by her rivals - who allied with Portuguese to remove her from power... A 30-year struggle. She fought against the Portuguese alongside Imbangalas from 1626 to 1655 - in many of the wars she commanded herself.

In 1654 she gave up her military life and thus returned to diplomacy with the Portuguese.

Significance of Queen Njinga:

- Set an example for her followers (including Imbangalas) to give up their Imbangala ways, bearing children in the camps.
- Her reign was also signified with the rise of European slave trades, where she used her power to regulate, by sending diplomatic letters to the Portuguese - she gained material goods and personal conveniences.
  - Return of her sisters.
  - Gaining "favours" for the slaves lost to the trades.
- A convert to Catholicism, some of the earliest examples in Africa.
  - May have aided her diplomatic interactions with the Portuguese.
- Perculiar attitude towards slaves - calling them thieves and bold faced... Maybe a common attitude toward outsiders and those in doubt?

### Santana Plantation

A group of slaves on Engenho Santana, a large plantation in Ilheus of Brazil (in the south, far away from political centrals), where slaves killed their overseer, seized some of the plantation's machinery and formed a settlement in the forest... Efforts were put in to capture the slaves, but none proven effective. The slaves were forced to negotiation by pressure. A treaty was formed for conditions to return to their plantation as slaves, while the principal of the uprising would be imprisoned.

The uprising was significant mainly for its "peace treaty" formed by the negotiation. The central pieces of the treaty was in the regard of quotas required in the task system (significant drop in daily quota, and moreover, women should have lower quotas), and to the access of independent subsistence plots for the slaves (Saturday and Sunday allowance to work on their own plots). Their desire to "play, relax, and sing without needing permission" was also expressed in the treaties.

The slaves were often complained by their owners that they worked little but complained a great deal - a sense of self-awareness? Also, the owners themselves were *Jesuits*, while they showed little paternity to the slaves - may be due to a lack of recognition for the slaves as human beings.

Slaves also seemed to have grown their own portions of food, and cultivation of manioc was also found.

### Olaudah Equiano

Born around the Bight of Biafra, his father was a slave. At age of seven, he was kidnapped with his sister by slave raiders around his village. He was past through several masters, with varying experiences with transportation and his masters.

His fears with the Europeans came with their different appearances - lighter skin and hair, and relatively tall. In his autobiography, he recalled seeing boiling pots - which he thought that the pots were used to cook him. Along with other who tried to commit suicide, he too refused to eat - but was forced to eat after all.

Arriving at the United States, seeing white men on horses - he sees it as a kind of magical art. He was also fascinated by others reading (off a piece of paper, "looking at it..."). Just an evidence for some slaves who had never been exposed to such actions - he even thought at one point that his master was talking or listening to the book - a kind of witchery.

His master gave him the name Gustavus Vassa, named after a king of Sweden. On board of the ship, he found himself involved with the slave trade between British America and Carribeans. Later, he even travelled to the United Kingdom, where he was baptised. Throughout his experience as a slave, he made numerous voyages across the oceans.

With fear to be re-enslaved after 1766, he moved back to the United Kingdom in 1767. He set his home base in London. Whereafter he made numerous travels in Europe and across the ocean, he even set up a expedition to find the North Eastern passage to Asia.

He even set up a plantation, furnished by Jamaican slaves.

- Born in Igboland (1745).
- Enslaved and brought to Barbados (1756).
- Sold to a naval captain in Virginia (1757).
- Purchases freedom (1766).
- Sets up a plantation in Nicaragua (1773 - 1777).

And later, back in London in 1777...

- Becomes involved with the abolitionist movement (1780s).
- Publishes first edition of The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano (1789).
- Died in London, as a wealthy and well-known man (1797).

#### Question of his origin

He claimed that he was born in Igbo, but literary scholar Vincent Carretta argued in his 2005 biography of Equiano that the activist may have been born in colonial South Carolina rather than Africa based on Carretta's discovery of a 1759 parish baptismal record that lists Equiano's place of birth as Carolina and a 1773 ship's muster that indicates South Carolina.

- His baptism record in the London church suggests he was also born in South Carolina.
- In his arctic voyage, his ship master suggested that he was born in South Carolina.

These evidences suggests that *he invented his own identity*. But equally important is to know the reason/motive behind his identity.

#### Other evidences

- The name of Equiano, was never mentioned before his own autobiography. But this name is of Igbo origin, still used today.
- Equiano seems to have extensive knowledge about cultural details, including the "scarfication" process and his father's identity as a chief (*Embrenché*). The process of scarfication was usually performed at age of 13, the reason why he avoided this process - but how did he know about this (wasn't common knowledge)? His autobiography was one of the earliest record on these cultural practices in Igboland.
  - Moreover, his record regarding the linguistic changes during his transport to the coast, was in fact quite accurate.
  - Even if he was born in the United States, it would take extensive knowledge in Igbo language to communicate with those from the same area. Where else could he had learn the language?
- When using an autobiography, it is important to check details on the piece. When examining details, it is very important to check against multiple (or to exhaust) sources of evicences.


### Rice Plantations

William Dusinberre, "Them Dark Days".

- Work regime...
- Readings on slavery death.
- Climate...
- Child death rate.
- Comparison with other kinds of plantation.
- Did slave suffer social death (related to circumstances)?

Often found in South of the United States, and with higher child mortality rate than sugar plantations. Some of the aspects come down to the tropical diseases and an ideal environment for the growth of germs and baterias - and of course, harsh labour regimes, in which women were forced to work until they give birth (not to mention that they were even regarded to be less than women, or in their words, "lack of feminity and motherhood").

Even when a child was given birth to, malnutrition gives a better chance for the children to gain diseases with little chance in recovery - moreover, both parents may be working away from them, in best cases, carrying them to labour - a general lack of care.

With lack of child comes the lack of descendant... In African culture context, the lack of children signifies the lack of identity, as no one could live to tell your own story. In a way, the lack of offspring brought by a real threat of social death - added onto the circumstance that they were stripped away from their ancestors and kin, they were under even deeper threat of loosing their own identities.

However it could also be argued that with their connection/relation to other's suffering, they were connecting in a way... Forming new, non-biological kin and families.

### Kimbanda/Quimbanda

James H. Sweet, "Mutual Misunderstaindings: Gesture, Gender and Healing in the African Portuguese World".

An African ritual performed in the Brazillian colonies. Which often times involved male individuals dressed up as females, and act as medias of possession by ancient gods or ancestors.

Due to frequent bodily penetration, this practice was often times confused with sodomy or homosexual relationships by the Europeans - a sin in Catholicism, many were imprisoned for practicing the Quimbanda ritual. Such understanding reflects on the removal of cultural context of these ritual practices.

This ritual was more often found to be performed by male than actual female... Maybe, due to demographic changes in the male-centric Atlantic Slave Trade, or some believed that it is believed that male were more suitable as medium for possession.

### Harriet Jacobs

A female servant (born into slavery) in the American South who escaped slavery, who later raised her two children in the state of fugitive - and finally, a writer who wrote her autobiography "Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl".

She was also known for her perculiar relationship with her master, Dr. James Norcom, who was sexually fascinated with her - in the documentary, he was described to be following her virtually at all times, and expresses strongly of his sexual desire to her - and snaps whenever Jacobs shows disregard or disobidience to his demands.

The later turn to Samuel Sawyer, a white lawyer in town with quite a significant family origin to *escape Norcom's attention* - Jacobs later fell in love with Sawyer.

Jacobs later escaped - despite that Norcmo threatened to sell her children if she would not obey to his sexual demands. She hid in a nearby slaveowner's house to keep an eye on her children, and later to a swamp, then her grandmothre's shack - in the attic for seven years. Her children were later purchased by Sawyer to allow them to live with Jacobs' grandmother.

Jacobs escaped to the North (Pennsylvania) in 1842, and in 1845 with help of her abolitionist friends moved to the New York state to work for Natheaniel Parker Willis' home as nursemaid ("waiting-maid") - not as slave, as slavery was completely abolished by law in 1827 in New York.

...

She was later joined by her brother, John Jacobs, who also escaped slavery and joined the abolitionist movement (moreover, found a school in 1849 for black education). But was later disappointed and feared the Fugutive Slave Act of 1850 - as they both still were runaway slaves. Ironically, John Jacobs' speech was even quoted during the passage of this piece of legislation. John Jacobs moved to California, and was later joined by Harriet Jacobs' son.

### Sister Chicaba

Sue E. Houchins and Baltasar Fra-Monlinero, "The Saint's Life of Sister Chicaba, circa 1676 - 1748: An As-Told-To Slave Narrative".

One of the earliest African women to be recorded in modern European languages. It was a collaboration between Sister Chicaba and Father Juan Carlos Miguel de Paniagua, where she provided information for assembly of a biography.

Chicaba stood out for her cause and method of escaping slvaery, "by exhibiting her extrodinary holiness" according to the author (healing and performance of rituals?).

Chicaba was born the youngest daughter of King of Lamina Baja del Oro, in contemporary Eastern Ghana, Togo, and Benin. She was quickly noticed to be of significant upbringing, for her wearing jewelry upon capture, and that her name "Chicaba", meaning "golden child", or "divine gift". She was given a name when baptised, as Teresa.

Upon emancipation, she stated her will to join a convent, where it was believed to provide intellectual and spiritual freedom - more importantly, sexual safety - as compared to a free but secular life.

It was also important to note that since the Middle Ages, the blacks were demonized as... devils. She was identified by her priest as "Turkish" for the difficult position to take in her identity... But in all, it was an attempt to incorporate Africans in an European religion, where the Africans themselves became an integral part of domestic religious stories.

In all, Sister Chicaba's story expressed a view on monastic women's life in Europen countries, either as slaves, or as members of convents.

Essay Prompts
-------------

- Did the Atlantic slave trade transform earlier forms of slavery in Africa (first reading)?
- To what extent did slaves suffer a social death when they were enslaved and sent to the Americas (lecture notes, especially; Vincent Brown; Smallwood)?
- Did Africans accept their fates as "commodities"?

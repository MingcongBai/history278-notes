Week 11: African Healing in the Diaspora
----------------------------------------

### Questions

- How did African forms of religion/healing change from Africa to the Americas? What was gained/lost?
- Did Africans make contributions to the intellectual history of the Atlantic world? How?
  - How did the ideas and intellectual forms from Africa inform the world of African's transformation to the Americas and Europe... Or the other way around?
  - "Creolisation", and the idea of Europeanisation...

### The Assumption of Creolisation

It was often assumed that with the lack of creolisation, there could not have been cultural interaction or recorded history. The interaction between Africans were often ignored, and that it implicates that creolisation...

- Could only happen between Africans and Europeans.
- Could signify cultural and civilized history.

It was often found that scholars and museums (or other institutes of similar function) put in significant effort to connect creolised with the Christian faith (as seen with exhibits in the Jamestown museum) - "Most West Central Africans practiced traditional African religions until contact with Europeans... began to spread Christian ideas to the African people..." - could Africans have influenced Europeans in regards of culture and religion?

As we have seen last week, Christianity was probably interpreted and abridged to African context by the Africans themselves - baptism and other canonical Christian ideas may have meant little more to "protection" and divine existence to the Africans. Was it true that Africans unidirectionally accept European culture and religions? Probably not - and thus it may not be fair for Europeans and modern scholar to assume unidirectional "assimilation" of Africans to the European context, and it should be noted that creolisation goes both ways.

### Calundu

Calundu is from Kimbundu word of *Kilundu* which means "ancestor", a ritual healing practice from Central Africa, consisting of dancing, music performance, drinking, spiritual possesion, divination, and healing. There are frequent references to calundu in Brazil, Jamestown and other early African settlements in the Americas, in the 1600s.

Given the circumstances in the 1600s with little knowledge of scientific reasoning for sickness, and the general feature of isolation - Europeans were often found to be participating in the Calundu rituals, and they often appreciated the idea of the rulings of African ancestors...

One example has a traveller stopped by Salvador, Brazil in 1717 (according to French travel log), it was logged that music and dance was performing - the leader of Salvador, the traveller was invited to Christmas celebrations, nuns were brought to the open platform, songs were directed to sing in little collaboration - as a farse, "as if they were possessed". Later followed with silence, and a long speech from one of the nuns with "corrupted Portuguese... like the way the Africans talked...". Revealing hidden ideas in foreign languages, much like what was done in Calundu rituals. While not exactly the same as Calundu, but the idea was similar - with virtually identical framework, dancing, performance, and corrupted language - bringing a sense of justice to their own community, exposing issues, like public healing, it (attempts to) heals both personal and social illnesses.

(And thus the white women in the centre of the "usual" calundu picture...)

White settlers were often found to be appreciating or subjected to African healings, and it was believed that it posed challenged to the centrality and absolute position of whites and their Catholic churches. Europeans were also found to be "Africanised".

### Calundu, over time...

And the evolution of Calundu.

Calundu remains important Central African spitirual system in Brazil until late 1700s, with the shift of slave origin from West Central Africa to the Bight of Benin...

- 1770s to 1780s: *Fon* rituals from the Bight of Benin began to be confused with Calundu.
  - *Fon* ritual performers were even put in inquisition for the belief of them performing Calundu rituals... wizardry...
  - A reflection of European's relatively simple assumption about African history and cultural traditions.
- 1775: Domingos Barbosa performs *lundu* in Salons of Lisbon (coming back from settlements to Europe).
- 1780: New and "refined" *lundu* makes its way back across Atlantic, so *lundu* became the prototypical "dance" of whites and mixed-race people in Brazil - a form of creolisation.

Thus, by late 1700s, three branches of Calundu was formed:

- Old Central African rituals.
- Generic "African" rituals (washed down version?).
- Luso-Brazilian dance (departure from original religious context).

### "Disappearance" of Calundu

By "disappearance", it was meant that documentation of such ritual was lost in the 19th century by the large part.

Lundu, a Luso-Brazilian dance became of the dominant branch in "Calundu rituals" - as in itself, it was not... Old, specifically Central African forms of "calundu" all but "disappeared" although the rituals survived in Central African slave communities in Brazil, especially in Rio de Janeiro (any particular reason?) - for the dense slave population in that region, and frequent arrivals to this area as compared to other regions in Brazil.

### Calundu in St. Domingue

By 1790s and up to 1760s, a series of laws were passed to prevent African slaves from performing *calenda* dances (while the majority of slaves in this region were orignated from Central Africa, specifically, Congo)...

- In prevention of gathering of revolt-prone population - a political threat (much like Domingos Alvares).
- In prevention of "indecent postures" found in *calenda* dance.
- A new military branch was formed in effort to prevent "gathering of negro dancers".

In all, a similar erasure of Calundu from official records.

### Calundu in the United States

"King" Charley of Angola in Albany, New York (1710s) - and [Ring Shout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_shout). There was a record of a ritual took place in this region. Charley, a drummer, singing in foreign language, while surrounded by dancers, in a counter-clockwise direction.

While there was no specific record of ritual possession, it should not be assumed that it did not take place. As a political and spiritual leader in Central Africa (leaders often held both functions), Charley was regarded as the "Prince of Africa" - was this Calundu? Hard to say...

### Side Notes

- The first Africans were brought to Jamestown in 1619.

Mining, in Africa and parts of the Americas
-------------------------------------------

Mining (gold, silver, diamond), European enthusiasts find mineral ores with higher value. Mining could be dangerous and labour intensive for miners - slaves, of which slaves from the Gold Coast were preferred by masters. Due to limited technology assist, slaves were required to dig straight into mountains. Mining continued in Brazil (*Minas Gerais*) and areas of Senegambia. Especially in the case of Minas Gerais, mining was found to be more profitable than plantations.

Lives in the mines were distinctly different. Slave miners were set to mine ores at a quota - excess were kept by slaves for their own disposal. Slaves with mining experience were sent to Minas Gerais, where 2/3 of the ~88% slave population were from the area of Gold Coast or Senegambia. In mining regions, men-to-women ratio varied from 5:1 to 100:1 in certain periods of time - implications?

In diamond mining, any slave who managed to find exceptionally large diamond was publicly celebrated and in some cases, granted freedom and weapons (or other goods from Europe).

Urban Slavery
-------------

Mostly found in Lisbon, Mexico City, Cartagena, Salvador, Rio de Janeiro, Charlesto, Havana, and New Orleans - most of which were major port cities. Slaves in these area worked a great variety of occupation:

- Porters, muleteers, peddlers, hawkers, laundresses, housekeepers...
- Masons, goldsmiths, blacksmiths, cobblers, seamstresses...

Urban slavery was characterised for its relatively low slave ownership per capita, but the scale of slavery was still significant in urban areas. For example, in mid-18th century Rio de Janeiro, between 1/3 and 1/2 of the ~20,000 residents were enslaved, and the average slave ownership per capita was ~3.5.

Domestic versus Agricultural Slavery
------------------------------------

Some questions involved with this comparison...

- "House slaves": better clothes, better food, perhaps some education. Easier lives?
- Would you rather work in the house or in the fields?
- Which situations is closer to social death? Why?
- Was social death a realistic possibility?

Week 12: African Contributions to Runaway Communities, Rebellions, and Revolution
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Questions

- What constituted "slave resistance"?
- Why was armed rebellion so infrequent?
- What were African contributions to runaway slave communities in the Americas?

### Defining Resistance

Slavery is an unnatural form of human interaction, and thus resistance seemed natural as compared to slavery.

#### Why didn't African engage in more overt forms of violent resistance more often?

It is quite difficult in fact for slaves on a working regime because quite oftenly they were separated into smaller groups, which inhibits coherent political organizations. Though there were examples, especially in Haiti, there were larger slave concentration, making it relatively easier to gain congregation.

Why, then, are violent resistance still rare? It could be mostly blamed on the psycological issues. As slaves, they were constantly threatened by their master (violent retribution from them) and social death. The trauma along their Middle Passage and daily exploitation could run down a person's will to resist an institution...

In general, slave resistance are attempts to fight against an *institution* that defined people fundamentally as properties.

#### What are some everyday forms of resistance?

Though simple, those actions slowing down the efficiency of the labour regime were at the very least, attempts to damage their master's ability to sustain a stable regime...

- Work slow-downs by damaging machineries and tools.
- Faking pregnancy.
- Faking sickness.

However, there are cases of negotiation by their masters, that provides certain benefits to the slaves... By providing these benefits, the masters may gain in general, that the masters now own cooperative slaves.

- *Are slaves fighting against the institution of slavery, or fighting against the effects of slavery within the institution?*
- *Are they strenghtening the institution, or fighting against it?*

#### Was stealing from the master resistance?

Is it really stealing as a master stealing...?

Frederick Douglass, a great abolitionist. He argued that the stealing of the master's property is merely "moving meat from a tub to another", although it seemed like a resistance, stealing from the master is merely a "transport" of properties - and it still would be owned by the master.

Again, this is a question of institution, or the effects of an instituion...

#### How about...

- Speaking African language and keep the masters out of conversation?
- Building families and communities?
- New religions?

Asserting oneself as a human...

### Resisting the Institution

As mentioned above, there is a clear distinction between the two main forms of resistance (though one of which largely trivial in regard to the institution).

By running away or forming rebellions, slaves literally removed themselves from the institution of slavery... Runaway slaves existed since the beginning of slavery, from 1500s, it was reported in now Haiti by the Spanish settlers that they damaged property, stole horses, and ran away from their work - moreover, attacked the Spanish settlers.

### Yanga's Village

Gaspar Yanga, a slave allegedly held royal line - born in Gabon - led a group of slaves to the mountain outside Veracruz. The group grew to 500 people, raided on Spanish caravans and grew their own food to sustain their community.

In 1609, Spanish tried to conquer the village with 350 people, but the attempt failed. Yanga's son drove against the Spanish raid, resulting in a stalemate. The Spanish then agreed on forming a treaty, granting freedom on condition of allegiance to Spain - and thus paying taxes to the Spanish Crown, and sworn loyalty to the Crown - thus forming a free town out of Yanga's village.

It is important to point out however, that as a part of the treaty, any future slaves that ran to this village for shelter shall be returned to the Spanish as fugitive slaves. It is exhibited here that slaves were not always united.

The village, later moved to lowlands on a hill over the Gulf of Mexico, was renamed "Yanga" since 1930.

### Benkos Bioho: Cartagena

An African slave from contemporary Guinea Bissau named Domingo Bioho fled into the foothills outside Cartagena, and changed his name to King Benkos. King Benkos then led rebellion in Northern Colombia, which defeated two Spanish expeditions - despite the twice amount in people.

King Benkos retreated further into the interior as a result, and founded the village of Matuna. In 1605, a similar treaty was signed with the Spanish... Bioho was hanged and quartered in 1621, for his village held runaway slaves - instead of returning them as Yanga did - furthermore, he was accused of fermenting rebellion.

#### Palenque de San Basilio (de Palenque)

Though King Benkos was captured and killed by the Spanish, the village sustained - the survivers of Matuna migrated further into the interior. It survived as an independent *nation* for roughly a century, until 1717, when it accepted Spanish rule.

*In 2005, the village was made a UNESCO Heritage site, with a population of ~3,500.*

The language spoken is Palenquero, the *only* Spanish-based creole language in Latin America. Combination of Spanish, Kikongo, and Portuguese. Not understood by Spanish speakers...

*"Palenge a senda tielan ngombe ri nduse ri betuaya..."*, meaning *"Palenque is a land of cattle, sweets, and basic staples..."*.

### Palmares (Brazil)

As mentioned before, the Spanish first attempted to enslave Indians (Native Americans). The community started with Santidades, Indian religious communities in late 1500s, committed to overthrow Portuguese - as masters of white people. They believed that with the overthrow of slavery, they would create a utopia.

References would be found that in 1588 there were records of Africans joined Santidades... By 1612, large numbers of Central Africans slaves displaced indigenous slaves in Brazil, and so Santidades became known as *mocambos* - a word for "hide-outs" in the West Central African language Kimbundu.

#### Central African Influence

After 1620s, with an influx of Imbangala warriors (or their victims) from Central Africa, *mocambos* became known as *quilombos* after the name *kilombos* of the Imbangala warriors in Angola - a much more politics-charged word as compared to *mocambos*.

#### Mature Palmares: Mid-17th Century

By the mid-17th century, the *quilombo* of Palmares had a distinct Central Africa flavour, *Angola janga* (Little Angola). The leader was Ganga Zumba (*n'ganga n'zumbi*, or spirit priest).

- Palmares meant palm trees, Imbangala's migrate routes were determined by availability of palm trees...
- At peak, Palmares as 10 separate *quilombos* with thousands of residents.
- Dutch and Portuguese tried in multiple attempts to destroy and re-enslave Palmares but failed.

#### The End of Palmares

In 1970s, tired of constant aggrevation and expeditions, Ganga Zumba negotiated peace with the Governor of Pernambuco: Ganga Zumba and others would be pardoned if they moved closer to coast and returned all fugitives not born in Palmares.

One general, Zumbi, refused the deal. Zumbi was born in Palmares in 1655, became the military leader of Palmares - alleged to have poisoned Ganga Zumba for the making of the treaty... And continued to resist attack from the Spanish and Dutch expeditions for two decades.

In the last battle of Palmares in 1695, he was defeated and beheaded and Palmares was consequently destroyed.

#### Legacy

*Quilombos* were found elsewhere in Brazil and other parts of Latin America, but Palmares remained as one of the most famous - films were made about this particular *quilombo*.

### Buraco do Tatu

A runaway community north to Salvador, destroyed by Portuguese in 1763 - existed for 20 years - a total of 65 residents in the village. A more "typical" example of *quilombos* in Latin America...

- Self-sufficient (with some thievery to supplement needs).
- Always on the defensive against invasions.
- Led by two captains, also often mentioned with two "sorcerers" (clear political structure).

The significance of this village is that despite its smaller size, there are a large amount of documentation dedicated to this locale - including a graphical map of this fortified village - for the huge pits around the village, with spears at the bottom, covered by leaves. *Other villages of mainly Central African residents could be found with similar fortifying mechanisms.*

Buraco do Tatu was destroyed in September of 1763.

### Concluding Remarks

Runaway communities as resistance? Is this a form of resistance against the institution?

Yanga, Benkos Bioho, San Basilio de Palenque, Palmares, Buraco do Tatu... Regardless of cultural origins and cultural evolutions of runaway communities, the motivating factor for runaway was always flight from slavery, **resisting slavery by leaving it behind and forming new communities.**

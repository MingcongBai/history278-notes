Week 2: Slavery and Economy in Africa
-------------------------------------

Africans, as discussed last lecture, is an concept imposed by "outsiders" - who does not live on the continent - was a concept that covered people of the whole continent, in which case, 500 years ago, no one on the continent identified themselves as "Africans".

(Map) shows that languages of Africa could mostly be seen to be arranged geographically, in some cases, scattered all over the continent.

### Slavery in the Americas

What are images that we generally associate with slavery in the Americas?

- *Plantations and cottons.*
- *Kidnapped and brought to the Americas.*
- *The Southern regions of the United States.*
- *Open-air markets, slave markets.*
- *Inhumane treatments by both the sellers and owners.*
- *Underground railroads.*
- *Middle passage, slave ships.*

But these images are mostly associated to the more recent accounts for slavery, as discussed later... As we will see, slavery in Africa begun quite a while earlier before Europeans and populations of colonies started the trans-Atlantic slave trades.

What are images that we generally associate with wealth in the United States in 2017?

- *Money.*
- *Properties, land, and big businesses.*
- *Power and influence.*
- *Entrepeneurship.*

These questions are intended to discuss notions of slavery and wealth... In our question today, it is a choice between land and slaves. *If you are currently at the frontier/in the middle of nowhere, would you rather have a slave or a plot of land?*

*"Owning land in a frontier context, practically no one would care about land ownership - as there is no initial value, nor would anyone care - I would rather have a slave to help me with clearing the land, and make value out of it."*

Just a simple reflection on the definition of wealth, in private property - in the traditional sense in Western cultures.

### Wealth-in-land versus Wealth-in-people

The primary form of wealth building in Africa was through the accumulation/gathering of people, *not* private ownership of land. *Wealth-in-people as w ealth-in-knowledge - just imagine how you would develop or at the very least, survive in a frontier landscape... If you only had a certain kind of knowledge.*

Now then, how do you accumulate people?

- Marriages and plygyny (marriage of more than one wife).
- Reproduction/adoption.
- Pawnship (seizure of people in justification of debts).
- Patronage.
- Conquest, enslavement of captives.

Slaves were the principal form of private, revenue-producing property recognized in African legal systems (as opposed to land). Who, then, were the populations of slaves consist of?

- Prisoners of war, or captives of war.
- Pawns.
- Orphans.
- Criminals.

Commonality? All were outsiders, strangers - seoparated from their lineage and kinship communities - marginalised population. In the Congo language (Kikongo), the word *mvika* could be defined as a "kinless outsider":

*"Despicable outcast, without money, without influence, without defense, exposed to all insults because nobody will stand up for him."*

â€” Bittremieux, 1922.

Interestingly, in the same culture, being "free" means to have association with kinship - as opposed to what western cultures tend to associate with the same word. Think of an African society as a continuous spectrum between kinship and slavery - where freedom is a direct equivalence with kinship, of the ownership of such.

### Escaping slave status

Note that in African cultures, an outsider slave *could* integrate itself into a kinship by learning the language and marrying into a kinship family - children of slaves *could* become free in such process.

### Transformations of African slavery (The Atlantic Slave Trade)

Rodney - Fage debate.

Thornton, in accordance with John Fage and David Eltis, argues that the arrival of Europeans did not transform African slaving. On the contrary, Europeans simply tapped into the already-existing markets.

Two critical question constitutes our discussion this week:

- *But did the Atlantic slave trade transform African economies and forms of slavery? Or did Europeans just continue tapping into these markets?*
- *What happened to African forms of slavery and economies when the Atlantic trade began?*

The first transformation of African slavery was the change of direction. There used to be trade routes across the Saharan desert of Northern Africa - as soon as the Europeans showed up for trades and slavery, Africans started to transport goods and slaves to the Western coast of Africa.

### Transformations after 1680

Ever-increasing demand for slaves in the Americas - unheard of by most Europeans and of course, the Africans themselves - the *demand* of Europeans transformed African society:

- African economies centred more and more on the Atlantic slave trade.
- Most grops both victim and victimizers.

In the pursuit of wealth and goods, Africans started selling their own slaves (exporting). The main difference was that Africans did not tend to sell slaves (as seen the wealth-in-people notion), which was essentially forced to change for the lucrative trades. Because the trading of slaves appeared to be the most direct path to goods and wealth - and more importantly, with wealth and goods, people could be gathered more effectively by leaders - those who sells slaves to the Europeans.

### Case study: West Central Africa

The trading hub of African slaves since the 17th century, contemporary Congo, Ruwanda, and Angola. The kingdom of Kongo, the Portugese first arrived with Christianity faith - in which case, the king of Congo travelled to Portugal to study Portugese and made formal arrangements with the king of Portugal for the trading of slaves. With regulation and power in hand, people in Congo deliberately started the trade of African slaves from the West Central Africa.

With such environment for trading, other countries (especially those in Europe and colonies) started to arrive at the ports of this region to join the trade. This disrupted the normal (and relative order of) trading routines.

With foods being brought by Europeans, the economy in the region started to centralize on the question of slavery. With such economic changes, came great political instability to the region - and of course, brought conflicts among the Europeans, and Africans against some European countries.

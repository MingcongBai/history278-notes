Week 14: Social Hierarchies - Africans versus African Americans
---------------------------------------------------------------

### African-born versus American-born Slaves

A phenomenom found throughout the Americas, with negative sentiment against African-born slaves - by both American-born slaves and slave owners.

### Exchanging Our Country Marks

What are country marks...?

Symbols of nationality, literally markings on face, chest, and back - to distinguish themselves among the crowd of Africans and African Americans - and of course, this also refers to the traits and characteristics (religious, cultural, etc.) of an individual, which could be shared among a similar group of people.

#### Divisions

Divisions among slaves and the shift from ethnicities to race, how?

There had been a shift in demography in slave communities in the Americas...

- To 1720, most slaves in the United States were either African-born or raised by Africans.
- To 1820, most slaves were "Americans" - with no direct links to Africa, removed from recollections of their origin.
  - ~8% of slaves were still African-born, many of which first generation (thus would last 2-3 generations in their influence).

The shift and lag of this demographic change resulted in a "class rift" between African and American born slaves - American-born slaves, for their fluency in English and labour experiences/skills, were assigned to occupations with more freedom and skill requirements; as opposed to African-borns, who were still heavily influenced by Africa, therefore assigned with lowest skill occupations.

Over time, this "class rift" based on labour distincitions moved to a distinction of cultural markers, entrenching the "rift" further...

- Religion (Christianity, many domestic slaves converted under influence of their masters).
- Race (lighter skined people, those mixed-race offsprings; women, for their perceived beauty).
- Culture (adaptation of master's practices and culture, self-perception as "closer" to masters, taking heir).
  - Descent from royal families, Christian slaves... A claim of dominance while denouncing other Africans.

Many American slaves spoke with contempt - especially ex-slaves in their WPA interviews - looked down on African-borns of their "savegery" and Curse (of Ham). Ex-slaves repeated the oppression endured by their own ancestors.

#### Ethnicities to Race

Though "class rift" existed, it was not rigid as it was perhaps had been portrayed. African-bornand American-born slaves often married and ran away together, crossing lines of nationality of race. These boundings were evident in many stories told among the slaves and African/-American communities...

- Red cloth.
- King Buzzard.

(See "Exchanging Our Country Marks")

In the stories of "Red Cloth", as the African Americans may well know the roles of Africans in enslavement of Africans, why did they ignore the involvement in recollection...?

- Evading blame and guilt, forming an innocent figure.
- Prevent division and promoting unity in African/-American communities.

An essential truth, so to speak, putting the blame upon Europeans. While the story was not exactly true, the story, as mentioned above, had their own agendas. As Africans kept on immigrating to the United States, internal dialogues in regard to enslavement helped creating a concensus - a unified idea which did not exist back in Africa, nor was it found in the United States.

Onto "King Buzzard" then, a similarly popular story communicated throughout the United States South. The story goes that King Buzzard, a chief who conspired with Europeans to sell his own people to the Europeans in a deal - tricking Africans by luring them onto the boat himself - as slave source depleted in his area, King Buzzard himself was enslaved ("knocked over his head").

King Buzzard, as he became "useless", was done into slavery. As he arrived in the United States, he was despised by his peers (obviously). After his death, he was punished to remain on the Earth eternally as a buzzard.

- As compared to the "Red Cloth" story, this version acknowledged the African involvement in slave trade.
- As compared to historical results, there was only one victimizer in the story as opposed to multiple entities.
- Similarly, it was not often that slaves were captured within their own kin - at the very least, not without a reason of exclusion.

The story, while acknowledging African involement, did not acknowledge the divison from within Africa - nor were they ignorant enough to be deceived by a single chief over and over. By assigning an "ultimate betrayer", it is similar to the agenda of the last story that they tried to create a unity as "Africans" - a unified entity of victims of betrayal (though most were captured and sold as captives, it could not be portrayed as betrayal).

*A story shared by both African-borns and American-borns, and by both Christian and non-Christians... Forming a single idea of "race".*

### Creolization: Religion

Conversion to Christianity among the Africans/-Americans remained rare until the late 1820s...

- Language barrier?
- Religious persistence?

... After which slaves converted on their own terms, adapted Christianity to their own - often consistent to religions in Africa - Chrstianity was then converted/grafted onto African forms.

*Ring Shout: Slaves converted to Christianity as it provides a rationale for mass trauma and suffering in slavery and post-emancipation years. The focus shifted from the connection to ancestors to a God, and a reunion of their communities - Africa the continent as a place of redemption.*

It is important to note that ring shouts existed before the mass conversion to Christianity, the form of ceremony *persisted* through the mass conversion as a mean of adaptation. And this exactly is why the conversion was successful in its intention: for its great degree of localization and adaptation.

This did not automatically guarantee a unified community, as many urban African Americans dismissed the idea of ring shouts - for its African cultural influence which was regarded with great contempt. Though difficulties existed, it is nonetheless an opportunity and rationale for unity, and to make sense of their past (Christian being sympathetic of suffering, and condemning those practicing harm).

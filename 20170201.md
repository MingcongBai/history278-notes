Africans in Europe
------------------

First Africans to arrive in Europe *via the Atlantic* in 1441 (while the first in the Americas was in contemporary Florida in 1513, however as a free man), as part of the Atlantic slave trades. By 1550, African descended represent nearly 10% of populations of cities like Lisbon.

Between 1441 and 1521, more than 150,000 Africans arrived in Europe.

### What did Africans do?

Those enslaved were responding to their masters, while those freed were living lives as ordinary European citizens, but with certain limitations. Africans were also found to be attending jobs at lower ranks in the society. Africans was also known to be working in factories (manufacturing soap), cleaning the streets, building canals, tending animals, etc.

There was a great variety of occupation freed Africans were attending by the time.

### African slavery from Iberia to Northern Europe

An early example of this development could be seen from the earliest English involvement in the Atlantic slave trades, especially those targeted the Americas.

- In the 1480s, couple of travelling English merchants in Spain owned, traded African slaves. Those notable names were William Holburn, Thomas Malliard, and Robert Thorne.
- In the 1550s, English enter slave trade to the Americas with Spanish and Portuguese assistance. Partnership between Antonio Pinteado and Thomas Wyndham was built during this period - upon Spanish's complete control over the trades - the example however, was remembered to be unsuccessful...
- In the 1570s, the Crown of England hired privateers to raid Spanish and Portuguese trade ships. [Christopher Newport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Newport), an English privateer, was the first to sail to Jamestown.

As slaves were traded to the Americas by the Englishmen, some African slaves returned to England. As population of black Africans grew in England, [Queen Elizabeth I of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England) expressed her discontent, recorded as follows:

*"... Highly discontented to understand the great numbers of negars and Blackamoors which... are crept into this realm since the troubles between Her Highness and the King of Spain who are fostered and relieved [i.e. fed] to the great annoyance of her own liege people, that the relief [i.e. food], which those people consume, as also for that the most of them are infidels, having no understanding of Christ or his Gospel."*

However, note that the English Queen did not directly refer to the Africans as slaves, but much rather focused on their religious differences and racial description...

### Does Europe become white?

Nearly all orthern Europeans adopt the term "negro" to describe Africans instead of all other words for black: *n√®gre* for French, *negro/negra* for Spanish, *neger* for Dutch/Danish/German, etc. The word "Negro" becomes synonymous with "African" and "slave".

Europe was divided in many ways, but united under the properties of being Christians, monarchical, and white. Meanwhile, the "negros" were deemed as outsiders, and the anti-Europe descriptor.

Extending racial ideas to the New World
---------------------------------------

Enslavement of Native Americas was introduced initially as a mean for concentrating of labour, possibly in the intent of convenience - as they inhabited locally.

The enslavement of Native Americans led to major population losses due to the unfamiliarity with diseases. Familiarity with environment and territories also made the Native Americans harder to enslave... American colonists (especially Spanish) turned to African slavery with the 1542 ban of Native American slavery - and in another regard, the growth of profits created by the African slaves in the Americas resulted in a spike in the demand for African slaves.

Not long after the Spanish and Portuguese, the English and French started to arrive in the Americas to start businesses - unsurprisingly driven by African slaves. As more African arrived in the New World, racial ideas hardened - early free Africans in the contemporary United States were demeaned as "negroes" and "alien", their properties stripped away, and virtually all of their descent enslaved.

Week 14: Social Hierarchies - Africans versus African Americans
---------------------------------------------------------------

### Questions

- Were there social hierarchies in slave communities of the Americas?
- What characteristics distinguished slaves? How did these distinctions shape slaves' lives?
- Did hierarchies in slave communities differ across the Americas? How? Why?
- Was slavery "milder" (not as harsh) in Latin America than in the United States?

It is important to differentiate and distinguish among African slaves - we separated people between the groups of "Africans" and "Europeans", however, neither groups were homogenous - especially with the change of time and location.

### Categories of distinction

- Occupation
- Religion
- Nationality, birthplace
- Race, skin colour
- Sex, gender
- Age
- ...

### Occupations

As we have known before (History 277?), there were "house slaves" who worked in homes as servants, and "field slaves" who worked long hours in the field and fully exposed to elements. It was often assumed that "house slaves" experienced a "milder" slavery as compared to "field slaves", but it was argued in Gomez that this could well be a mistaken assumption.

Even when looking at "field slaves" alone, their occupations could be distinguished... Working in the mills, working in the field...

### Religion

Muslims versus non-Muslims... Recall, the South Carolina and Georgia examples - "the Christian dogs...". Back in Africa, there had already been distinctions between Muslims and non-Muslims, and thus social hierarchies:

- Education and literacy
- Multilingual
- Reliable and faithful

These features were also valued by slave buyers, who took them as better candidates - along with the considerations that they were monotheistic - they were often purchased at higher prices, and were often put in occupations of overseers and slave drivers. However, Muslim slaves did misbehave, which could had driven their image the other way - for example, the Muslim slaves in Espanola who raided their own plantation and stole horses...

### Nationalities and Birthplaces

Wolof, Yoruba, Igbo, Mina, Angola, Kongo, etc...

Ideas originated from Africans and later hardened as categories by European slave traders. The distinction between Africans (by Africans themselves) led to decisions with marriages and childbirth - as most Africans married within their own kind. Distinctions made by slave buyers were often attributed with differentiated merits among the nationalities.

Birthplaces... Born in Africa or in the Americas made distinctions among the slaves. In earlier slave trades, most slaves came from Africa and spoken African languages, while later - especially in the United States, for the ban of Atlantic Slave Trades, slaves became more and more common to be born in the Americas.

### Race, Sex, Gender, Age

- Mixed-race versus black...
- Sex, gender: male versus female, quimbanda...
- Age: old versus young...

#### Do the enslaved replicate hierarchies formed by their masters or adopt their own?

Some hierarchies made between the comparisons above could be originated from Africa, while some could be originated from Europe and the Americas... While the influence and adaptation of these hierarchies between the two groups were mutual.

### Slavery in the United States versus Latin America

- Siete Partidas (Seven Partitions): 13th Century Spanish legal codes, precedent for governing slavery in the Americas.
  - Gave certain individual rights to slaves (however, not given freedom or recognition to their rights).
  - Defined slavery as "necessary evil", and set up rules to "protect" slaves.
- As argued in Frank Tannenbaum Thesis *Slave and Citizen* (1946)...
  - Legacy of these laws made Latin American slavery "milder" and "benign" than in the British North America.
  - Catholic church and their legal systems valued humanity - the Crown protected slaves.
  - Legal systems more readily allowed for manumission.
  - Strict hierarchy of racial categories and social statuses allowed for social mobility - *castas*.
    - As shown in pictures, the marriage status (of races and statuses) could alter the offspring's social status ("With an Indian and a Black a wolf is born..."). Therefore it was possible to "return" to white/as Spaniard.

Could the nature of slavery be altered with the imagination and arguments regarding the understanding of slavery and legislations?

#### Do castas liberate or constrain?

Tannebaum's thesis picked apart... Slvaery constrained people despite the "opportunities" that sometimes existed, not everyone get to have the chance to move "up" or "down" in *castas*.

- How could slaves take advantage of these legislations?
- Were laws always enforced, religious principles followed?
- Do everyone get to have the chance?

Yet in some places, the Crown and Church did protect slaves - Cuba and Mexico for instance - via marriages, baptisms, manumissions (emancipation), etc. In these places, the effects of slavery could be mitigated by taking advantage of these legal codes and religious rules.

Still, does this prove that slavery could be "milder" in Latin Americas? How do the distinctions discussed above affect their ability to take advantage of the *castas*.

#### Stratitifaction

- Not all (or less likely) slaves were able to access these "rights," especially Africans.
- Animosity between Africans and slaves born in the Americas - which was reinforced by slave owners.
  - One Brazilian born slave was worth four of those born in Africa.
- The Crown and Church did work in favour of some slaves, however, their ability to execute and provide the "rights" were hindered by their social statuses and distinctions discussed above.

Further more...

- "Rights" provided by the Church and the Crown could worsen the likelihood of these providence.
- Africans married outside the Church and exclusive Catholic brotherhoods could cut of the opportunities for outsiders - through finanical and discriminatory means, sometimes prohibited African-born slaves, and the fees of membership were often prohibited - even when they were admitted.
- The *vast majorty* of manumitted slaves were *not* born in Africa.

#### Manumission in Rio, 1749 - 1754

At the time...

- 78% of slaves were African born, 22% were Brazilian born. Central Africans were 66% of African slaves, the majority of which were men.
- Roughly 30% of slave populatioin were men from Central Africa.

However...

- Out of 605 manumissions in this period...
  - 185 were provided to men.
  - 180 were provided to Africans - 43 of which men, out of which, 13 Central African men.
  - Only 3 out of the 13 were freed unconditionally, ~0.5% of all 605 emancipated in this period.

And what we see from the manumisson system...

- It favoured women over men.
- It favoured American-born over those born in Africa.

That said, distinctions over occupations, nationalities, gender, etc. could indeed affect the chances on these "opportunities", and more often than not, chances were extremely low for some specific groups.

### Conclusion

Some slaves could indeed take advantage of laws and religoius principles for their own ends, but these same institutions could worsen slavery, depending on where a slave was born - and who they were as slaves - hardening the system further against some groups.

Thus some institutions designed to "amelionrate" slavery only worsened it, emphasized equation of slave with African, expecially male. While it could still be questioned that whether slavery was "milder" in Latin America, it is often times more reliable to question in regard to slaves' own experience in these periods.

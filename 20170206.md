Week 4: Enslavement, the Middle Passage, and the Politics of the Slave Trade
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Key questions

- How did the slave trade work in practical terms? What did the trade look like from the perspective of traders and the enslaved?
- Did Africans suffer "social death" when they were loaded onto ships and carried to the Americas?

### The Middle Passage

During the period of 1518 to the 1860s, more than 36,000 slave ships made their voyages across the Atlantic Ocean.

First European incursions were slave raids by the Portuguese, but quickly turned to formalised trades. The Portuguese government later established cooperations with the local empire and governments in an effort to gain formality and protection with the trade - and of course, to maximise profit - building castles and forts completed with administrative offices, residence; and more over, dungeons for the captured slaves waiting to be shipped across the water.

But slave trades conducted by the Europeans did depend mostly on the decisions of the local governments. From those regions willing to engage, slaves were captured by local slave traders from the inland, and marched along all the way to the coast - or in *coffles*, an Arabic word for carriages - while in areas along the river, the slaves were brought down on canoes.

Slaves were often found to be treated poorly, but the traders had to keep them alive for profit - one would often find the traders making calculations on how the slaves were treated, to miminise both death and money spent on the slaves themselves. Consequently (or much rather, for enslavement itself), the slaves often attempted to escape - to counter such issue, slaves were guareded with chains and iron casts.

Consequently, according to the book *Way of Death*, ~1/3 of those marching to the coast died before their arrival. After that, slaves were kept in dungeons, waiting for European slave ships to arrive - the among of time spent in dungeons could vary greatly in events of traffic difficulties - with shortage of supply for food, slaves died in large quantities during this period. African slaves brought to the coast were often found to be malnurtured along the way, on the sites of incarceration, slaves were treated with the same sort of *calculation* between the amount to feed for maintenance of the slaves, and the question of maximised profit - but after all, a large portion, in fact, adding with the deaths in the marchings, the total number of death will nearly be equivalent to the ~10 millions brought to the Americas. Sites of incarceration dotted the slave coasts of the Africa continent, with the growth in scales of the trades, the sites became more elaborate and formalised.

Those enslaved, after marching to the coast will find themselves effectively *stuck* - with unfamiliarity with language and terrains - they could be easily identified as slaves, and thus recaptured.

#### Inspections, and "suitability" of the slaves

The apparent vitality and visuals were essential in the slave trades, invasive inspections were made to the slaves in order to determine those who were more suitable (or *"lusty"* from the readings). Sometimes, the European traders would even rub oil on the slaves to make them "shinie".

#### European cannibals?

With the absence of any event when slave returns from capture, local people started to believe that the European traders were cannibals - extracting body parts from the Africans, and make products like gun powder and cheese out of them.

#### On the ships

Slaves could be waiting on the ships in the bays, waiting for a full load - before which the slave ships seldom left, again in concern of profit. But even after the ship departs, it could take around 3 months initially, but with the advancement of technologies, the duration of travel dropped around one month by the end of the slave trades.

Journeys were filled with uncertainties, in events of severe weather or undesirable current, the prolonged journeys could result in more death in African slaves - and of course, the crew members themselves.

Slaves were effectively "squeezed" in the lower compartment, the sheer amount of people kept in the compartments meant that disease could spread quickly with the less-than-ideal environments - feasies, urine, blood, and vomit - resulted in the lack of oxygen. More over, water and food supplies were provided with again, the same sort of calculation.

Women's condition on the ships were practically unimaginable, some gave birth on board, and many raped by crew members.

Without any surprise, large amounts of slaves were found dead mid-passage. Portuguese referred to slaves ships as "floating tombs". Many tried to escape and suicide, jumping over board into the sea - and consequently, nets were put around the ships to prevent such events. Dead slaves were thrown over board, attracting sharks and other dangerous marine animals.

#### Revolts and uprisings

According to statistics, ~10% of the slave ships were caught in events of slave uprisings - taking over ships and redirect its directions - but often times unsuccessful, and resulting in torturing and more mistreatment.

#### Diseases and quarantine

In events of quarantine due to concerns of spreading diseases to the port cities, inspectors could hold ships from the ports, resulting in much longer delays up to months - same issues with food and water all over again, but granted that if at crew's will, they could go on land and purchase food and water there.

#### Triangular trades

The slave trades were carried out in a triangular fashion:

- Textiles, rum, and manufactured goods to Africa.
- Slaves brought to the Americas.
- Sugar, tobacco, and cotton to Europe.

Ships would often times travel multiple passes on this triangular pattern, and many made good fortunes out of this method of trading.

### Social Death?

*Did Africans suffer "social death" when they were loaded onto ships and carried to the Americas?*

#### What defines "social death"?

Lost of identity as a full person, the disconnection from kinship and community, and a barrier (a great difficulty) to recover as a full person again. Also, the lost of language, culture, and character - all those consistutes a full person.

Two concentrate the points...

- Absence of meaningful links to the past.
- Liminal, and marginalised position.

The keyword here is "death", a state where no one shall recover - at least not by natural means - the violent robbery of identity and honor resulted in such death. But it is also important not to ignore the implications of the lucrative market, those traders who would bring back the fugitive slaves for a reward given by the Europeans, and those cases when oppression were implied by the Europeans that renders them as commodities. Moreover, it is the combination of physical and social violence that brought by this death.

On the other hand, the re-union as communities - to an extent - rebuilt the identities of the African slaves as a person, the death is not a complete death. So to speak.

*"Slavery is the 'permanent, violent domination of natally alienated and generally dishonored people.'"*

â€” Orlando Patterson

#### Looking back

But all in all, were they socially dead? The following weeks will be dedicated to this question.

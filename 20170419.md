Africans and Islam in the Diaspora
----------------------------------

### Questions

- How does the history of Islam in Africa impact on the religion, culture, and economy of the Americas?
- Should we talk about an Islamic diaspora distinct from, or embedded in, what we call the Africa diaspora?
- Was Islam divisive in slave communities of the Americas?

### The First Muslims

The first African reached the Americas 1619, the first Muslims soon followed.

### Islam in Africa

The history of Islam began with the Horn of Africa (Somalia, Tanzania, etc.) in the 9th century by Arabic traders, and up to the North African regions (Egypt, Morocco, etc.). Trans-Saharan traders (slave or commodities) bring Islam across the East Coast and the Sahara Desert to the South.

Islam reached Senegambia in 12th century, but Islam did not become significant and established until the 15th century. Muslim leaders created libraries and schools for religious studies - forming scholarly centers. With this, Islam had to coexist with preexisting religions in the regions - to establish their own authority, and to survive in new environments. Today, almost 50% of the African continent has Islam majority.

In this regard, Islam could be considered as a religion of mercantilism - by trading and connections, the Islamic faith was spread throughout the regions.

#### Demography

Entrenchment of Islam in West Africa coincided with the arrival of first Portuguese merchants - and thus the slave trading. Many of the first slaves were Muslims, it was suggested that **~20%** of all who reached the Americas were Muslims - or at the very least, familiar with the Islamic faith.

#### Early African Muslims in the Atlantic

Slaves in the 15th century Spain and Portugal - *shahada*, calling Muhammad the messenger, and Allah as supreme.

- 1520s Hispaniola: Wolof slaves (many of whom Muslims) revolt, Spanish tried to ban the importation of Muslim slaves on the ground of infidelity of these slaves - and questioned their insubordination.
- 1550s Peru: Roughly 40% of slaves came from Islamic regions of Africa.
- 1550s Mexico: Nearly 1/3 of slaves were of Wolof, Tukulor, or Mandingo origin.

*Note: In the height of the slave trade in the 17th and 18th centuries, regions around Senegambia saw anti-slavery communities formed by Muslims to prevent enslavement - when it came to the event when they themselves were enslaved, they brought the idea over to the new environments.*

#### St. Domingue

St. Domingue saw Comparatively smaller numbers of Muslim slaves (most came from Central Africa). Muslims were usually used as house servans, as suggested by the stereotypes of Muslim slaves could be more intelligent (could read and write), and according to some, more attractive.

#### Francois Makandal

A slave from West Africa (exact origin unknown), ran away from his work regime in St. Domingue. Legend has it that he was a ring leader of a large group of maroons, poisoning cows and masters - knowing the nature quite well, making effective poisons from plants. He was also known to have spoken Arabic and read the Qu'ran, writing messages from the Qu'ran and put in people's *Bolsos* for protection. However, it was also speculated that he was not Islam, but was possibly educated in Muslim schools.

He was captured in 1758, and was sentenced to death by burning - but he claimed that he would become a fly and run away - as he struggled, he broke the tie onto the pile of wood to have him burned, he was allegedly killed later after the crowd at the execution was evacuated (also found in *Assassin's Creed*).

#### Muslim communities in Jamaica

Muhammad Kaba Shaganugu, born in contemporary region of Guinea in 1756. There was a wave of *jihad* in Africa in his time. Originated from a rich and scholarly family. He was kidnapped on his way travelling to his uncle's home to study law, and sold to Jamaica for 56 years on a coffee plantation.

Being educated, he was found carrying a book in the 1820s - the "Book on Praying" - with advices on prayer, marriages, burials, etc.

#### British North America

Muslim slaves were most prominent in Sea Islands of South Carolina and Georgia, but also scattered through Carolinas and Lower Mississippi regions. At least 230,000 of the ~481,000 Africans who came to the United States as slaves came from areas of Africa influenced by Islam.

Slaves were also found to have maintained the religious practices and languages - or even convert those who weren't related to them.

#### Islam and Stratification

- Muslim slaves typically saw themselves as superior to other slaves, due in part to divisions in Africa of similar nature brought to the Americas.
- Slave owners - as mentioned above - saw Muslims as more intelligent, more dignified, more reasonable, etc. Muslim slaves were often given privileged jobs: overseers, slave drivers, etc.

#### Ayuba Suleiman Diallo (Job Ben Solomon)

Born in a family of Muslim clergy in Senegal, trading paper and slaves. In 1720s or 1730s, on a journey home, he and his crew of collaborators were attacked by Mandingo slave raiders and sold into slavery - mind that this was not uncommon. He arrived in Maryland in 1731, but was considered "unfit for plantation" work by his slave owner - however, he was found to be good with herding cows.

He ran away soon after, but was captured and imprisoned for return. For his ability to speak and write Arabic, his lawyer was deeply impressed. Solomon wrote a letter back home, calling for his family to purchase him back for freedom. He ended up in London, and his letter was translated in English, raising enough money for freedom - and became a celebrity.

In 1734, he returned to Senegal and to his family - and allegedly returned to slave trading.

#### Lowcountry Carolina and Georgia

There were significant numbers of Muslims in late 18th to early 19th century, forming pockets of Muslim communities, and two examples of Muslim slave leaders who prevented slave defection or deserting...

- St. Simons Island: Salih Bilali (born in contemporary region of Mali).
  - Became slave overseer from trust of his owners.
  - During war of 1812, he prevented slaves from deserting.
  - By 1816, he was named the head slave driver (of 480 slaves) on the plantation.
  - Died in the 1850s, last word allegedly "Shahada".
- Sapelo Island: Bilali Muhammed.
  - Born in contemporary region of Guinea.
  - Born to family of educated and educated in Islamic schools.
  - Sold in slavery to Georgia.
  - Learned French and English in addition to Arabic.
  - Helped his master with controlling slaves in the war of 1812, fending off the English troops.

### Question... Again.

Africans slaves were the first Muslims in the Americas (inlcuding what became the United States). How does this fact challenge our understanding of the history of Islam in the post-9/11 era?

- Islamic Africans were brought to the United States (or the Americas) by force.
- Islamic history in the Americas are longer than that of the United States.

Week 8: Kinship, Lineage, and Family
------------------------------------

*"That's what America is about, a land of dreams and opportunity. There were other immigrants who came here in the bottom of slave ships, worked ever longer, even harder for less. But they too had a dream that one day their sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters, great-greandsons, great-granddaughters, might pursue prosperity and happiness in this land..."*

— Dr. Ben Carson

### Questions

- How successful were Africans in making families in the Americas? In the absence of "blood" families in the Americas, how did Africans create social bonds?
- If Africans were separated from their homeland and had difficulties creating new families in the Americas due to death, disease, and displacement, did they suffer social death?

### Ancestors, Spirit Mediums, Divination

If you believe you can communicate with your African ancestors in the Americas, through dreams, spirit mediums, or divination, *are you alienated from your natal kin*?

Although dreams may tie back with those remembered or experienced. Caterina Maria in Africa in an acquisition against her regarding dealings with the devil, explains that she experienced "night flying" - at night, she would fly back to Africa to return to her kin - although her freedom was limited in the day time.

...

Here below are some case studies regarding this topic.

#### Calundu

Often found in the United States, Haiti (then Saint-Domingue), and Brazil.

Similarly, Calundu (a word for "ancestors" in Kimbundu), is an act of public healing where one may be possessed by their ancestors during a ritual... To give cure to individual (physical) or social illnesses (those that slaves might suffer from). Calundu was also found to involve sacrefice of animals or very rarely, the ritual leader - to serve as spirit medium.

*With the frequent threat of alienation and the lack of biological kin, performing rituals served as a creative way to recreate families, reconnecting with homelands and ancestors.*

#### Vodun

Often found in the United States, Haiti (then Saint-Domingue), and Brazil.

Domingos Alvares created a Sakpata shrine in Brazil, a community built around worshipping the Sakpata vodun in the city of Rio. For his powerful influence on African communities, his master sent him around the city to perform healing - raising money for the master - and this, reflects that Portuguese in Brazil believed Vodun rituals to a certain extent.

Similar creations of "vauxdou families" in Saint Domingue, similar to Calundu communities.

*It was not until recently with Hollywood production that Vodun was "corrupted" as Voodoo.*

#### Asen

Often found in the Kingdom of Ahomey.

Iron altars dedicated to specific ancestor, ~2ft in length, with a statue like extension on top. Ritual performers offered alcohol and food to the Asen as a way to invite their ancestors back on Earth. The King, in fear of its power, banned this ritual practices - and those who practiced this ritual regardless were banished to slavery, and most of which ended up in Brazil.

This practices were found in Brazilian slave communities as a direct product of the King's ban. But also reflective of creative ways to recreate social bonds around healing rituals.

*The ability to harness with power of deceased ancestors, the communities were empowered and strengthened for new idioms of kinship and family in the Americas.*

#### Nkisi

Originated from Central Africa in contemporary Congo.

A statue/figure that could be possessed/empowered by spirits. Healers would sculpt these objects in order to connect with the spiritual world - to heal people of individual or social illnesses - spearing the object with needles and sharp metal was believed as a way to activate this object (symbolising oath... etc).

*And now you see how Voodoo dolls were brought to believe.*

#### In Conclusion

Slaves from the Africa brought their spiritual/ritual knowledge to the Americas to reconnect with their surroundings and their ancestors, to create their new kin and families.

### Recall: Kinship and Social Death

Social Death, as we know, is the idea that separation from family and friends means utter isolation; the trauma of social death, individuals were often times incapable of remaking the "social self".

#### Orlando Patterson

*"The permanent, violent domination of natally alienated and generally dishonoured persons."*

— Orlando Patterson

... And that they were forced to integrate into a society consisting slaves, where people did not belong, or could not find belonging.

#### Stephanie Smallwood

*"The imperatives of a market that valued people as commodities interposed a nearly impassable gulf between captives and any community that might claim them as new members."*

*"The socially dead did not - could not - ever return fully to social life."*

— Stephanie Smallwood

#### Question

IS this what happened to Africans in the Americas? Could African slaves achieve a "full social life"? Did Africans suffer "social death"?

#### Vincent Brown

A new community may be constructed from (social) death itself. For example, a woman died on a ship, when the shipmates intended to toss the body overboard, slaves onboard rallied to hold a proper funeral for this woman.

Vincent Brown does not disagree that social death was a concept in existence, but he noted that social death may create motivation to recreate oneself via events or doings - see the Haiti Revolution. Social death may be a condition looming over a context, but slaves may strive to work against social death - in order to *live*.

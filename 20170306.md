Week 8: Kinship, Lineage, and Family
------------------------------------

### Key Questions

- How does one define "family"?
- How successful were Africans in making families in the Americas? In the absence of "blood" families in the Americas, how did Africans create social bonds?
- If Africans were separated from their homeland and had difficulties creating new families in the Americas due to death, disease, and displacement, did they suffer social death?

### How does one define "family"?

#### Definition of Family

Often we think of it as male and female partnership, marriage, and biological reproduction, and the inclusion of children and generations - as social norm to this day. The key of this section is to define family for Africans in the context of violent working regimes. What are some other ways to express family?

These ways were often times ignored for its disagreement with *social norm*. In many African cultures, "kinship" is the basic social unit - kin groups often contained of course, direct relations in blood, however, it *also included* incorporation of people (slaves, adopted children - *wealth-in-people*). Only the latter feature is of any difference to families in our understanding. Kinship often times incorporated the system of polygyny, across multiple regions of Africa - commonly found with the wealthies and elites.

So what are the effects of slavery on kinship groups?

- Men and women taken away, prodominently men.
- Increase in polygyny.

New kinships were found in the Americas (although not natal) via rallies of communities in the context of violent to create new social bonds.

#### Creating New Kinship Forms in Africa and Americas

Africans often had flexible ideas about kinship, which allowed Africans to construct new forms of kinship to stave off isolation:

- Secret societies.
- Healing shrines.
- Military groups.
- Runaway communities.
- ...

However, there were ruptures, isolation to be found in these contexts. However, our focus today is to find the resilience in creating new social bonds and re-incorporating communities in the new contexts.

#### Sakpata

In Africa, the creation of stronger kin groups decreased likelihood of enslavement. In the regions of Bight of Benin, in 1720s and 1730s (now Benin, Togo). In the 1710s and 1720s, Whydah (by the coast) was a great kingdom, later, Allada (North to Whydah) joined the slave trade - and gained power, incorporating Whydah to form joint involvement in the Atlantic Slave Trade - Abomey (further North), joining the slave trade, militarily invaded the two kingdoms down South, making themselves one of the largest kingdom.

This, was a context of violence in the Africa. People fled to inland and mountaineous areas - attached to new forms of social bonds under faith and religion - especially *Vodun Sakpata* (and yes, related to Voodoo) - God/spirit of the earth in Fon/Ewe, the religion was believed to control smallpox, famine, and drought (social diseases/illnesses, public healing...). The root cause of these issues was the slave trade, and the surge in slavery. These social illnesses affected groups in a larger scale, perhaps more than individual issues like smallpox.

Isolated people gathered around *sakpata* priests and formed new kin groups, where family relations were recreated in these new groups, even parents - although defined within the religion, rather than blood. With growth of these communities, they had the capacity to even challenge the authority of King Agaja with their power in collective. However, for being a threat to the authority, they were often targeted for slavery.

#### Imbangala (Angola)

17th century Angola (where Portuguese arrived by the 1500s, and slavery was established since then), with the growth in slave trade - where most people found themselves involved in - and this in turn weakened the formal relation and regulation set in by the authority in Angola, furthermore, violence and chaos became a device for maximised profit. Kinship structures wwer also weakened in the new context that:

- Strength came from military power.
- Corporate military organization held *absolute* rejected old forms of natal kinship.
  - Did not allow women to give birth - killing children that were given birth to.
- Rejection of kin-based descent in favour of a society bound by a newly-forged warrior ethos.
  - Frequently moved and lived in forge-like structures.
  - Community concept: *Kilombos*.
  - Instead of traditional parents and relations, members of the Imbangala were mere strangers - they were forced to change themselves under new circumstances.

How did Imbagala sustain? Through recruitments and brutal initiation processes. However it is important to note that, this was not *everyone*, Imbangala remained a relatively small group - and merely one of many forms of rejection to traditional kin values.

#### Defining Families in Africa

Family in African context was a flexible, a *composite* of ideas and understandings determined by natal and corporate kinship that structured *sociability*, especially 9n highly unstable societies.

### How were families formed in the Americas?

- How did Africans constitues families in the Americas?
- In the absence of "blood" families in the Americas...

#### Marriages

Very few "Christian" marriages among Africans in the Americas - forcing marriages by declaring slaves unmarried a sin. Ceremonies were held for slave marriages, but received little regard from the Africans. Parents of children often baptised their own children to express a social bond, and definition of their own new family - ceremonies, for its lack of meaning to Africans, were never highly regarded in this period. For example, in 18th century Brazil, ~90% of African women who gave birth were not married in Christian ceremonies. This was a similar statistical range in 19th Cuba.

*This does not mean Africans rejected relationships, but much rather, that they rejected the validity of Christian marriages.*

However, high rates of endogamous marriages (within the smae ethnic, class, or social group): Guine with Guine, Angola with Angola, etc. For example, in mid-17th century Mexico, Angolans married other Angolans more than 88% of the time.

#### Why marry?

It is relatively safe to say that marriages had different meanings - common histories, common languages, and common identities.

#### Other forms of Kinship in the Americas (Examples)

- Family of Antonio, Zambo, Pedro and Antonia in Lisbon (in reading) - a kin group by langauge, culture, and experience.
- Fictive or adoptive kinship.
- Maroons, runaway communities, *quilombos* (*kilombos*, but a given name for runaway communities in Brazil).
- Catholic Brotherhoods and *cabildos* in Mexico and Cuba (often times infused with African and ethnic ideas and identities).

#### Shipmates and Ship Families

Even before their arrival in the Americas, new social bonds and communities were formed on the slave ships (for often times slaves were captured in the same approximate regions). In Brazil, for example, people referred to each others as *Malungos* (used to describe ancient ancestors from the sea) - and *malongues* (Trinidad), *sippis* (Suiriname), *batiments* (Haiti) for similar meanings. Shipmates to their parents and ancestors were therefore incorporated into the social bond created on sea.

##### Example: Ship Emilia.

In 1821, 391 slaves from the Bight of Benin were brought onboard of Ship Emilia bound for the Americas - 250 of them were Nagoes (Yoruba for nowadays), 71 were Hausas, and others divided from different ethnic groups - 2/3 of them male.

By this time, slave trades were outlawed in the Northern hemisphere by the British (with a deal with Spanish and Portuguese government). Caught by the British navy, the ship was captured and was meant to be brought to Sierra Leone - however (accordingly) for issues of currents - the navy let the ship sail to Rio de Janero, for further treatment... The British government did not know what to do, therefore put them in the warehouses - and declared 14-year term in apprenticeship - some of these slaves stayed in the warehouse for more than two months.

Few knew what they did in the 14 years as apprentices... By record, some worked for social institutions, fixing street lights... But at the very least, they kept their connection with each other - and later petitioned to the Brazilian government to be freed early, but they spent their 14 years nonetheless - one apprentice were wealthy enough to get hold of a ship to sail back to Nigeria with those sailed to Rio together - the sail was successful for this group.

Apprentices did not regard the "grant" of freedom highly, owners of apprentices would brought dead bodies of an African to declare the death of their apprentices - they were therefore allowed to keep the apprentices for over 14 years.

These shipmate families resisted the "threat" of individualisation and social death, and created social bonds with their own creative ways... And there were more cases of returning slaves.

### Extra Notes

- *Qimbanda*, and the practice may have incorporated women - however, it seemed like the duality of these Qimbanda healers were regarded as their unique power.

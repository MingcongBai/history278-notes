Week 5: Primary Source and Atlantic Slave Trade
-----------------------------------------------

### Olaudah Equiano. or Gustavus Vassa

Born around the Bight of Biafra, his father was a slave. At age of seven, he was kidnapped with his sister by slave raiders around his village. He was past through several masters, with varying experiences with transportation and his masters.

His fears with the Europeans came with their different appearances - lighter skin and hair, and relatively tall. In his autobiography, he recalled seeing boiling pots - which he thought that the pots were used to cook him. Along with other who tried to commit suicide, he too refused to eat - but was forced to eat after all.

Arriving at the United States, seeing white men on horses - he sees it as a kind of magical art. He was also fascinated by others reading (off a piece of paper, "looking at it..."). Just an evidence for some slaves who had never been exposed to such actions - he even thought at one point that his master was talking or listening to the book - a kind of witchery.

His master gave him the name Gustavus Vassa, named after a king of Sweden. On board of the ship, he found himself involved with the slave trade between British America and Carribeans. Later, he even travelled to the United Kingdom, where he was baptised. Throughout his experience as a slave, he made numerous voyages across the oceans.

With fear to be re-enslaved after 1766, he moved back to the United Kingdom in 1767. He set his home base in London. Whereafter he made numerous travels in Europe and across the ocean, he even set up a expedition to find the North Eastern passage to Asia.

He even set up a plantation, furnished by Jamaican slaves.

- Born in Igboland (1745).
- Enslaved and brought to Barbados (1756).
- Sold to a naval captain in Virginia (1757).
- Purchases freedom (1766).
- Sets up a plantation in Nicaragua (1773 - 1777).

And later, back in London in 1777...

- Becomes involved with the abolitionist movement (1780s).
- Publishes first edition of The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano (1789).
- Died in London, as a wealthy and well-known man (1797).

#### Question of his origin

He claimed that he was born in Igbo, but literary scholar Vincent Carretta argued in his 2005 biography of Equiano that the activist may have been born in colonial South Carolina rather than Africa based on Carretta's discovery of a 1759 parish baptismal record that lists Equiano's place of birth as Carolina and a 1773 ship's muster that indicates South Carolina.

- His baptism record in the London church suggests he was also born in South Carolina.
- In his arctic voyage, his ship master suggested that he was born in South Carolina.

These evidences suggests that *he invented his own identity*. But equally important is to know the reason/motive behind his identity.

#### Other evidences

- The name of Equiano, was never mentioned before his own autobiography. But this name is of Igbo origin, still used today.
- Equiano seems to have extensive knowledge about cultural details, including the "scarfication" process and his father's identity as a chief (*Embrench√©*). The process of scarfication was usually performed at age of 13, the reason why he avoided this process - but how did he know about this (wasn't common knowledge)? His autobiography was one of the earliest record on these cultural practices in Igboland.
  - Moreover, his record regarding the linguistic changes during his transport to the coast, was in fact quite accurate.
  - Even if he was born in the United States, it would take extensive knowledge in Igbo language to communicate with those from the same area. Where else could he had learn the language?
- When using an autobiography, it is important to check details on the piece. When examining details, it is very important to check against multiple (or to exhaust) sources of evicences.

Week 15: Creolization - Africans Become African Americans
---------------------------------------------------------

During the era of the slave trade (do note that slave trade was abolished more than half a century prior to that of slavery itself), did Africans in the Americas recreate specific African cultural institutions, or did they weave together a variety of cultural traditions to create distinctly new African-American cultures (creolization)?

Do dates matter in this question? Certainly, slavery influenced significantly on African inflow, and with the decrease of African inflow to the Americas, African culture and languages mixed with local cultures and languages - some disappeared or decreased in their prominence - though many persisted (see reading). Considerable debates on the survival of African cultures and ideas in the Americas do exist. Typically, as a limitation, these debate are brought under the umbrella of creolization - were slaves in the Americas Americans or Africans - though creolization should have meant the mixing of cultures ("multi-culturalism"), it could often found to be more Europeanization than anything else.

The Debates on Creolization
---------------------------

- Melville Herskovits and African "survivals" in *The Myth of the Negro Past* (1941).
  - Travelled in areas of Dahomey and Latin America.
  - Argues the Africans in the Americas *remained* influenced by African culture, surviving centuries of slavery and emancipation.
- E. Franklin Frazier...
  - Argues that African American culture were mostly European-influenced.
- These two 1940s literature kickstarted the debates on creolization.
- In 1960s, it was commonly believed and argued that Africans lost all aspects of African culture (political influence, effort among some scholars to emphasize the oppression on Africans by Euro-centric American government and society).
- In 1970s, new work revealed African influenced on contemporary cultures.

Here below are two main sides of the debates...

Mintz and Price
---------------

Published *The Birth of African-American Culture* (1976).

Argues that Africans arrived in "heterogeneous crowds," (in regard to their cultural and geographical origins) but not communities (homoegeity as observed with the European immigrants and their cultures) - a "miracle" of creolization, a new culture created by slavery - in other words, Africans shared little similarities in term of cultures. They also argues that shared cultures among Africans in the New World existed only insofar as Africans *created* them - new non-natal bonds forged among Africans against oppression of slavery.

Further more, it was also argued that there was *no* transfer of African langauges or institutions to the Americans, as mentioned above, they were created in the context (or as a direct response) to their living circumstances - while some pidgin languages survived the Middle Passage, however they were rarely understood mutually.

To be fair, they admitted that African and American cultures influenced bi-directionally, however, it was pointed out that American cultures ultimately overwhelmed the influence - were there European creoles with Africans, or even transformed into Africans?

John Thornton
-------------

In response to Mintz and Price (in the 1980s and 1990s, some referred to as revisionists of history), he argues that Africans did not arrive in the New World in randomized crows - instead, Africans came from three distinct cultural regions, with seven distinct sub-cultures - social relations, traditions, and cultures not only survived the trip, they thrived in the Americas to form mutual influence with local cultures (though we often believed that Africans held great cultural specificity and heterogeneous features).

Thornton further argues that Africans often found people with similar languages/cultural ideas and were able to create communities that could maintain, develop, and transmit African cultures - though languages and all other features did not match or were uniform at all times, and in some cases people were unable to understand each other, there held capacity to create bonds and understanding among the countless cultural variation in African cultures and languages. The argument in short is that he believed Africans held at the very least, cultural similarities.

Perhaps more significantly, he pointed out in relation to his research of slave trade (voyage) database, that typically one boat would pick up slave exports in either one place or multiple near-by ports, and drop them off at destination(s) of the same nature. The implication here is that most slaves on board of slave ships, Africans could find people to relate to - with similar or identical language, religion, and cultural practices - there were far less heterogeneity than homoegeity.

Though sometimes slave owners tried to mix Africans by their origins to prevent mass uprise and disobidience, it was more often found that these owners kept slaves of roughly same origins - for traits and skills held by those slaves of a region - further maintaining the homoegeity nature in American slavery.

Africans often found people with similar languages/cultural ideas, and were able to create communities that could maintain, develop, and transmit African cultures.

*(Counter arguments could be made with Thornton's overly optimistic view of African cultures - see occupation discrepencies, urbanization, Africans versus African Americans, etc. - as another extreme as compared to Mintz and Price)*

Creolization?
-------------

During the era of the slave trade, did Africans in the Americas recreate specific African cultural institutions, or did they weave together a variety of cultural traditions to create distinctly new African-American cultures?

Look over readings and lectures for second half of the semester: Domingos Álvares, Calundu, Haiti (and Revolution), Mechael Gomez on Islam and Christianity, African languages (dictionaries), Joao Réis on Manuel Joaquim Ricardo... *This question will be on the final exam as essay question.*

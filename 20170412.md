The Haitian Revolution
----------------------

### Questions

- Should Haitian Revolution be viewed on the same plane as the American Revolution and the French Revolution?
- How important were African influences in the Haitian Revolution?
  - Was it an African revolution?
- What were Haiti's impacts on broader anti-colonial movements in the Americas?
  - A a free, Black country...
- Why has Haiti's role in world history be forgotten (silenced, erased)?

"The Haitian Revolution remained as *the* most radical revolution in the history..."

### The Haiti Earthquake (2010)

~300,000 Deaths, a devastating earthquake for Haiti. There were a collection of reaction to the earthquake, calls for help, calls for support... And the language of the televangelists (of course). Pat Robertson, American televangelist, blame the Haiti Earthquake on a "Pact with the Devil", for their call for independence from France two hundred years ago.

### The Bois Caiman Ceremony

What Pat Robertson referred to was the Bois Caiman ceremony in August of 1791, slaves and freemen converged in a plantation in Northern St. Domingue (later Haiti), and planned a revolt across multiple plantations. A week later, this meeting was followed for a call for the destruction of all French and European planters and masters - a call for revenge.

- 200 slaves and freedmen converged.
- Presided over by Boukuman Dutty, to plan revolt.

At conclusion of the meeting, an oath of loyalty was sworn by all attendance - a pact in the drinking of blood. Thousands of slaves and freedmen started killing European settlers and planters, burning down properties... The violence lasted to 1804, 13 years after the meeting.

### Ayiti Becomes St. Domingue

- 1493: Columbus arrived in the Americas, bringing sugar canes.
- 1687: White population outnumbered slaves 4,000 to 3,000.
- 1700: Slave population increased to 9,000, outnumbered the Whites.
- 1750: 150,000 slaves, but fewer than 14,000 Whites.
- 1790: 500,000 slaves, 30,000 Whites, 30,000 free coloured. 90% of the colony was enslaved.

However it should be noted that the population of slave could be under-registered for purposes of evading taxation, etc.

#### St. Domingue

Sugar Machine: Plantations produced half of all sugar and coffee in Europe and the Americas during the period of 1776-1789 - constituting ~40% of France's foreign trade. With all the production and demands...

- ~30,000 slaves arrived each year.
- ~48,000 slaves arrived in 1790 (one year before the Revolution).
- Most slaves from Kongo.

It is of great significance that over half of the slaves engaged with the Revolution were not born in St. Domingue. In addition, the French Revolution was sometimes claimed to have casted influence on the French settlers on the colony - Abolitionist movement was set in motion in France, but little effort was transported back to the Americas. However, it will be unfair to claim that French Revolution has no influence whatsoever on the Haitian Revolution.

#### The Haitian Revolution

Were they influenced by the French Revolution into gaining freedom, liberty, and faternity? Scholars wanted to claim this connection, so did the plantation owners - who believed that these new ideas may "corrupt" the slaves into disobedience.

Therefore, we should instead look more at Africa's influence...

- 2/3 of slaves were African-born and in 1791, over half of the slaves in St. Domingue had arrived since 1786.
- Small majority of recent arrivals were from West Central Africa (Kongo).
- Allowed for effective connection and **organization**.

### An African Revolution

Communication (or the ability to), as described: "They can barely say two words of French, but in their country were accustomed to fighting wars"... Kikongo, and other West Central African languages allowed for organization since large groups of people could communicate in the same (or at least, similar) languages.

Organizations of military bands were framed by "nations", and military tactics were largely adapted from Kongolese tactics - for them "accustomed to fighting wars", many knew the tactics and the skills to use a gun - as compared to the Europeans, the Kongos tended to have more dynamic tactics between charges and retreats, as compared to stand-offs that Europeans tended to prefer for "proper warfare" practices. However, it should also be noted that some tactics were not originated from Kongo, but rather from Maroons who hid away from slavery - therefore held tactics in these wars.

Kongolese political ideologies about power also influenced the motives and methodologies of the Revolution... Referring to slavery as a "wrong" form of human relationship and treatment, giving the basis of Revolution.

*Leaders had to rely on African langauges, tactics, and ideologies for the revolt to succeed (for some political leaders were not born in St. Domingue): constituting an African Revolution.*

#### A continuing warfare

- September, 1791: at least 50,000 revolutionaries, just one month into the revolution.
- January, 1793: King of France was killed in the Revolution, and thus transformed into a Republic.
  - Britain and Spain declared war on French Republic (also note that on the island where Haiti resided, to the west was a British colony, and to the east was a Spanish colony).
  - Revolutionaries joined and allied with the Spanish people, for a joint enemy.
  - Some planters in the colony stilled supported monarchy, and thus allied with Britain to the West (Jamaica).
- October, 1793: French Republic "frees" slaves - as citizens of France - to co-opt their military power, but not a deliberate will to form equal rights for the ex-slaves in humanitarian means.
  - British army invaded Haiti from the West.
  - Spanish army invaded Haiti from the East.
  - Republican French army stuck in the middle.
  - Not merely a "Race War" between Whites and Blacks, but a far more complicated system of political conflicts.

#### Toussaint Louverture

Once a slave, son of a man from Dahomey - became a leader of the Revolution. Fought for Spain against Republican French, leading ex-slave insurgents. However, later as the French Republic called freedom upon the slaves, the joined the French Revolution in 1794 - bringing Henri Christophe, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, and ~4,000 troops along with the alliance.

Later in 1794, Spanish and French came to a peace treaty - now war remained between Republican France (along with ex-slaves) and British (and allied French monarchists). Louverture, leading an army of Africans, defeated the British in 1798, and thus took control of St. Domingue. Louverture of all, controlled most revolutionaries in St. Domingue, holding more power than Republican France in the area.

In 1799, Louverture began re-instituting plantation labour, to preserve liberty (planter and labourers were paid to work) - even invited exiled French planters back to guide management - to preserve liberty with strong economy, relied upon by other world powers, a difficult balance between heroic reolutionary struggles and stabilization (though followed with rebellions against Louverture).

In 1901, Louverture drafted the Constitution for the Colony of St. Domingue, affront to French power - concerns arose regarding possible independence of St. Domingue. In January of 1802, Napoleon sent ~20,000 to depose Louverture and re-institute slavery in St. Domingue.

#### Back to war

Toussaint Louverture surrendered in 1802, then tricked and arrested by French General Leclerc.

Famously, before Louverture was put on the exile ship, he declared, "In overthrowing me, you have cut down St. Domingue only the trunk of the tree of liberty of the blacks; it will grow back from the roots because they are deep and numerous...". Louverture was then sent to a French prison, in which he died in April of 1803.

Jean-Jacques Dessalines also surrendered to the French, and was charged by Napolean France to disarm revolutionaries. With no real intention to surrender, he used the opportunity to re-stock weapons for later rebellions (carrying out his "duty", only to a certain extent) - new rebellions followed (some against Dessalines, but thanks to his chiasma, he was able to convince the majority to unite - regaining the status as a leader), led by ex-slaves Sans-Souci and Macaya.

It was the realization the French had come to re-impose slavery, and so ex-slaves united against them - including the Republicans - including Dessalines. Racialized violence followed, to ever larger extent. The Revolution transitioned to a united front against the *threat* of slavery.

#### St. Domingue becomes Haiti

- November, 1803: Dessalines was leading a powerful army and defeated the Napolean French. More then 50,000 French soldiers died.
- January 1st, 1803: Dessalines, born a slave in St. Domingue, declared new independent state of Haiti, after original Taino name *Ayiti* for the island - whose original residents largely exterminated by Columbus, a symbolism against the history of colonialism.

### Impacts of the Haitian Revolution Across the Atlantic World

- In 1791, slaves in Jamaica sung about the 1791 revolt within one month.
- French planters fled to Cuba and the United States, created a yelow fever epidemic in Philadelphia in 1793.
- In 1805, slaves in Rio wore medallions with the image of Dessalines.
- General hopefulness in colonies of freedom.
- The loss of Haiti forced the French to convey the Louisiana Purchase - constructing 1/3 of territory of present-day United States...


### Haitian Revolution: Erased, Silenced, and Forgotten

French government refused to recognize Haiti, on diplomatic or economic ties were constructed.

In 1825, after threats and coercion and to avoid economic embargo, Haiti agreed to pay indemnity to France: ~150 million Francs for lost property (mostly slaves) - in comparison, France only received ~60 million Francs for all Louisiana territory sold.

Haiti was still paying debt until 1947. In late 2003, Haiti demanded France to re-pay, which equaled ~21 billion U.S. dollars including interest. The United States did not recognize Haiti until 1862.

#### Haiti as an "Unthinkable" Event

Claims that French Republicanism, or "Enlightenment Ideals" caused the revolution were denied, and further claimed that the fact that African slaves could envision freedom on their own was "unthinkable".

"Human beings devise formulas to repress the unthinkable and to bring it back within the realm of accepted discourse."

— Trouillot (Reading assignment)

#### Unthinkable...

Western historians continue to reproduce these narratives, this silencing about the Haitian Revolution that it originated from "advanced" external thoughts and ideals.

This was, and remained the most radical revolution in history. The Haitian Revolution was the ultimate test to the universalist pretensions of both the American and French recolutions - and they both failed.

Defining the African Diaspora
-----------------------------

### Diaspora

The movement, migration, or scattering of a people away from an established or ancestral homeland.

### Diaspora versus Migration?

Migration limited in **scope and duration**, while diaspora involves movement of **more** peoples to **various** destinations over **a long period** of time.

### "The" African Diaspora?

This would not be an accurate definition:

- African diasporas occurred in various incidents, but mostly lasted over a long period of time (trade routes, and slave-trades, etc.).
- People living in Africa before the 19th Century did not have a concept of identification that they themselves were "Africans" (clans, tribes, kingdoms) - rather, this is a definition imposed on them.

Africans' diaspora lasted over the period from before slave trade (before the Europeans arrived), Africans were involved in migrations over the Sahara Desert and extensive trade routes to the Middle East and Asian countries (a picture of a giraffe brought to China). In the 1440s, the first African slaves were brought to Portugal.

Atlantic Slave Trade
--------------------

### When?

1440s - 1860s.

### Where?

Mostly from the West Coast, but found at nearly all of coastal Africa, from Senegambia around the Southeast coast of Africa (comtemporary Mozambique). Arriving all over the Americas - Mexico, Peru, Caribbean (British), Brazil, and the United States - mostly at colonies.

### How Many?

Roughtly 10 million Africans arrived in the Americas; at least **twice** that number enslaved in Africa.

Historical Methods
------------------

How do we uncover the histories of people who were mostly **illiterate** in Africa and then mostly enslaved in the diaspora?

- Trade data: shipping, insurance, etc.
- Property records: wills, slave sales, tax records, etc.
- Catholic Church records: marriages, baptisms, burials, etc.
- Judicial records: civil/criminal reports.
- European ethnographic descriptions: traders, travelers, priests, etc.
- Oral traditions: languages.
- Material culture: art, tools, ritual objects, jewelry, etc.

Now it was quite clear that the historical methods are largely associated around external (or third-person) accounts, records and notes will be the main source of information during the learning of this history.

Modern African Diaspora
-----------------------

*"The modern African diaspora, at its core, consists of the millions of peoples of African descent living in various societies who are united by a past based significantly but not exclusively upon "racial" oppression and the struggles against it; and who, despite the cultural variations and political and other divisions among them, share an emotional bond with one another and with their ancestral continent; and who also, regardless of their location, face broadly similar problems in constructing and realizing themselves."*

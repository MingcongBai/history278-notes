Week 6: Africans in the Markets of the Atlantic
-----------------------------------------------

... Or, Africans at Work.

### Key Questions

1. What were the roles of African slaves in the Americas?
2. Was the work of slavery different in different places (Brazil, South Carolina, Jamaica... Rural and urban... House versus field)?
3. Did slaves ever become fully commodified? Or, were Africans reduced to the products of their work - sugar, rice, etc.? Did Africans suffer *social death*?

### Rural Agriculture

Products: rice, tobacco, cotton, and sugar. Exported mainly to Europe - where sugar and cotton dominated the market.

Due to the large scale of plantation in Brazil, a significant portion of slaves in the Atlantic Slave Trade ended up in Brazil. The plantation model was adopted by the English and Dutch and adapted around the Carribeans and other parts of the Americas. The nature of sugar plantation requires industrial integration with the field (machinery close to fields, and worked in a flow), highly skilled slaves were involved, good soil required. The sugar growth requires up to nine months to be harvested - and at times of harvesting, the machinery could work up to 20 hours per day.

*Certainly, the utilisation of slaves lowered the production cost.*

#### Roles on sugar plantation

As a highly industrial process, the roles at sugar plantations were separated with their duty - the list below contains roles only for times of harvesting:

- Cane cutters (machetes, labour intensive; quota involved, some 4000 canes were required to be cut per day), and bundlers (paired with cutters).
- Transportation (sugar canes in bundles brought to the mill, often using ox carts).
- Wood cutters (keeping the fire going for boiling down the sugar, and works alike).
- Crushers (dangerous job, crushes the sugar canes - as soon as possible after the canes were cut - for the sugar-rich juice; the ~4000 canes *each slave* brought in per day were crushed).
- Stokers (after the juice is ready, the juice were brought in for cooking; worked below the cauldrons to keep the fire going).
- Kettlemen (cooking the sugar, skimming and mixing for higher purity; keeping the juice hot to eliminate moisture; requires good coordination with the stokers, preventing hardening and at the same time, keeping it hot).
- *Tacheiros* (or teache-men in direct translation; pour off the juice into large wooden/clay containers in the "curing house" - to dry off and crystalise).
- Purgers (pour water from the top, cleaning the hardened syrup for any remaining inpurities).
- Craters (assembling crates, and packing sugar to crates, and thus preparing for shipment).

The roles could be broken down further - as seen by some roles doing multiple jobs. Some of the roles requires great skills and requires training/experience - some may have already been doing it back in Africa, and thus highly sought after in the markets. Albeit some are back-breaking jobs and requires relatively less skills, but more blood and sweat.

Life expectancies in sugar plantations were less than 10 years, due to the dangerous and at times harzadous working environment - intense heat, and high chances of injury - and mistreatment.

*It was more cost effective to make slaves to work to death, than maintaining slaves and allow for reproduction.*

#### Was slave labour "modern"?

The first question may be the definition of "modern" - and this relates with what we see today in factories. However, the nature of factories requires a great deal of repeating work for relatively low reward for the labourers themselves.

But do notes that sugar plantations *predates* that of the industrial revolution.

*"The factories of the 1800s can be found in the plantations of the 1700s."* Sugar plantations were some of the earliest assembly-line-style production institutions, where efficiency and cost effectiveness were the key emphases - concepts carried to post-industrial factories.

### Rice plantations in South Carolina and Georgia

Or, *Was the work of slavery different in different places?*

Planters took advantages of swamp lands around rivers and canals for rice plantation - a crop requiring wet soil and still water on top. Also involved with rice plantations were intense labour and industrial-style production lines.

Slaves were sought after from areas of Senegambia for rice plantation - as rice were planted in the regions - thus a covenience to the slave masters and traders.

#### On planting rice...

Planting from April to June, and harvested in September.

#### What were there?

Diseases and stories of fortunate/unfortunate motherhood. Hot summer and large bodies of water brought in large scale diseases, either through purely climate factors and mosquitoes - say, malaria.

Mothers were required to work until the point of giving birth, giving birth were difficult due to this fact - physical violence resulted in miscarriages and stillbirths. Even those who managed to give birth to children, more than half of the children born did not reach the age of 6 - a direct product of the environment.

In events of death of their children, the parents were soon forced back to labour activities.

*What were the implications of a society where disease and death were so prevalent?*

### What do slaves do other than a simple plantation cycle?

They were either made to grow other crops on the same location, to prepare for the next season. Or more likely than not, sold to other owners for more plantation projects, a prevalent nature of slavery in the Americas is the high degree of mobility and dynamic in the slave populations.

### On Wednesday...

More examples of slave labour in more locations.

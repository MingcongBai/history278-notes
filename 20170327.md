Week 10: Religion, Spirituality, and Healing in Africa
------------------------------------------------------

### Questions

- What is "religion"? How does one distinguish religion from "spirituality" or "healing"?
- How should we characterize the beliefs of Africans in the zones of most frequent enslavement?

### Religion, Spirituality, and Healing

Explanation, prediction, and control of the temporal world - the "power" in ones' possession. Instead of regarding these concepts as categories, one should consider them with a certain degree of fluidity (therefore the recognition of their similarities and consequential connections).

- Communication with ancestors, God, Allah, etc.
- Monotheism versus polytheism (all attempts to achieve communal balance or reciprocity).
- Connections to the temporal world (the answers to larger and smaller issues... why are my cows dying, why is the sky blue...?).

There are variations in beliefs around different areas in Africa...

- Yoruba: Orishas (deities associated with winds, oceans, thunder, and fire).
- Benin: Voduns (Sakpata, as one example; Domingos Alvares).

What kinds of diseases are being "healed"?

- Individual illnesses (common discomfort).
- Social illnesses (social issues, unrest, and circumstances - isolation, alienation, starvation...).

... So, why not praise all of these Gods?

### Characterizing the Belief Systems of Africa

#### Bolsas de Mandingas

Used in Senegambia and Lower Guinea, a leather pouch worn around neck with medicines (blood, teeth, any object of power), passages from Quran (Koran) enclosed - protecting the wearer from harm. These pouches were distributed by Islamic teachers (marab'outs); adaptation of earlier form to include written prayers - spreading the religion.

- These pouches were later spread to Lisbon, Brazil.
- Some were used by Christians, enclosing different contents.

#### Christianity in Africa

In particular, in the Kingdom of Congo (Kongo), as visited by the Portugese for the purpose of slave trading. From the late 15th century, Kongolese elite began to *convert* to Catholicism. Catholicism spreads with European missionaries, indigenous clergy, lay preachers. Many familiar with rudimentary practices and prayers.

It is most important to note and understand the *convert*, this, is an example of religious localisation in Africa - and that the concepts of their old religions were integrated and explained under the interpretation of Christianity - possibly a different interpretation as expected by the Portugese and Italians...

- God: Regarded as the *original* ancestor, creator of all things (N'zambi M'Pungu).
- Baptism: Given salt (Yadia Mungwa), or takign of salt was seen as a repellent of evil - not a symbolic washing away of one's sin.

Then there are two questions to consider...

- Mass baptisms of slaves on the coast, as seen by the to-be slaves: witchcraft, eating, enchantment?
  - A question of limited understandings and perspectives...
  - Enslavement is a form of evil, regardless the form and practices...
- Integration of ancestral beliefs with the new Christianity... a new belief or a new addon?
  - Accumulation of faith and Gods... Domingos Alvares.

Therefore, the "conversion" here should be considered as a process of integration as opposed to a "zero-sum" or "replacement" of faith.

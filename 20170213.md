Week 5: Primary Sources and Atlantic Slave Trade
------------------------------------------------

### Gates' Video

- How does Gates' approach the issue of slavery in Africa, before and during the era of the Trans-Atlantic trade?
- What are Gates' biases?
- Who is the implied audience for the video?
- Based on your understanding of African history leading up to the Atlantic slave trade, is Gates' rendering of African hsitory balanced/accurate?

### Extra information found from the video

- Europeans were barred from entering the interior, permissions were required from the King of Asante - which were rarely given.
- The old king and his family of Asante no longer has direct political power, but still hold great respect (the mother of the king is regarded as "mother of all people", and takes care of social disputes). Old dynastic practices are still maintained.
  - Traditional Asante cultural practices were preserved in Northern Ghana.
- As one of the largest kingdoms involved in the slave trade, the Asantes sold their own captives and prisoners - it is argued that the slave trades constructed of the kingdom - on the other hand, people of power in the kingdom thought that they did not have a choice, and would have exited the trade if they knew what had happened to those sold to the Europeans.
  - But all in all, they were motivated by profit.
- Notorious, perhaps more so than Asante, was the Kingdom of Dahomey. However, there was a king who tried to stop the trades - failed - but still remembered today as a hero.
- For some descent of slaves, it could be still unsettling to come to places where their anscestors were captured.
- Merchandises of witchery nature are still sold in markets.
- Old slave traders' descent are still not regarded highly in today's coastal African countries, and some are still haunted with a sense of guilt.

Week 13: Islam, Language, Names, and Oral Traditions
----------------------------------------------------

### Questions

- How important was langauge in maintenance of culture, history, and tradition?
- What were impacts of losing language and names?
- To what extent were Africans able to maintain languages and oral traditions?

### Language, Names, and Oral Tratitions

Africans arrived in the Americas speaking the languages of their homelands, African languages were often most commonly spoken languages:

- Wolof in 16th Century Portugal, Santo Domingo, Mexico, Peru.
- Kimbundu and Kikongo in 17th Century Colombia and Brazil.
- Igbo in 18th Century Chesapeake.
- Kikongo in 18th Century St. Domingue and South Carolina.

This is not just sounds made with one's mouth, language is the key to the forming of social bounds and association - a tool for basic human interactions. Africans, upon arrival in the Americas were given new names and were exposed to new concepts - most of which they would not be able to comprehend. Language then played a key role in their understanding of the new environment, seeking for help, and forming non-natal kins.

With the overwhelming amount of people speaking native African languages, the slave owners and settlers too had to learn to interact with the African people - learning the language, and comprehend their expressions.

#### Kikongo Catechism in 17th Century Brazil

Why would a Portuguese priest write Catechism in Kikongo? Additionally, Kimbundu words were found frequently in official Portuguese documents, Portuguese wrote dictionaries (*Lingua Geral de Mina*)...

*ganga zambi*, *ganga wisa*, *n'gunza*, ...

Therefore it could be assumed that Portuguese officials and clergies were able to speak, read, and comprehend Kikongo language... Significance?

- There were needs for interaction with African slaves, languages acted as a connective layer between slaves and masters.
- A general language, say, Mina - a common langauge *not* native to Afria, was a testimony to African interactions between slaves originated from different regions.
- On the dictionaries...
  - *Nosso Senor* (Our lord) - and in Mina *hihavoudodum* (White Man's Vodun).
  - A reveal of fear by the slave owners on the slaves, as seen with violent phrases provided with translation (see reading).

#### Saint-Domingue (Haiti)

With majority of African slaves and slave descents (free or enslaved) - but in large, slaves were brought in from Africa, while some were born in St. Domingue - and therefore a majority of people spoke not French but Kikongo in St. Domingue.

Just before the Haitian Revolution, a dictionary was produced by an elite planter in St. Domingue. The dictionary was integrated as a part of a book describing natural and human history in St. Domingue... As he fled to the United States, he attempted to recreate an encyclopedia he wrote back in St. Domingue (allegedly destroyed in the revolution, a 25-volume encyclopedia) - and in the process, recreated a dictionary *from memory* - a testimony of his fluency and understanding of Kikongo:

- *Chirurgien* (French, Surgeon) - *gangan n'kisi* (Kikongo, a medicine man; also with connotation of a priest, both a physical and spiritual healer).
- *Esclave* (French, slave) - *vika* (Kikongo, "kinless outsider", an individual without any other social attachments other than one's servitude).
- *Tout le monde dit* (French, everyone says) - *befo mondele - babos* (Kikongo, all the white people say).
- *Tu es empoisonneur* (French, you are a poisoner) - *gue'ie - n'doki* (Kikongo, you are a witch).

... From his book, we are able to see the integration of cultural values and understanding of Kikongo speakers. However, in the third example, we could assume a separation between African society and the "White Man's" society. However, it is also denoted in the last example, we could see a lack of common expression between the two languages, and an effort of appropriation for understandings between the two peoples - however, inconsistencies could be assumed in daily interactions - again, see the last example.

What's more, all these examples show that African languages did not die off in this region - not only did it survive, it thrived.

#### The United States

There were specific African influences in the United States. Igbo was common in 18th Century Chesapeake, so was Kikongo in 18th Century South Carolina... Say, *N'guba*, for peanut, was adapted into English with the same meaning.

- *Pidgin languages* - a mixture of several languages to form new one(s).
- Creole languages, as compared to pidgin langauges, were more fully formed and passed on to second generation as a native language.

As a 19th Century English traveller suggested, planters had "peculiar accent derived from almost exclusive association with negroes".

##### Uncle Remus' Tales

1881, Joel Chandeller Harris compiled tales of "Uncle Remus," a kindly old former slave who tells stories...

- Often "Br'er Rabbit en da Cow"...
- Taken up by Disney in 1946.

In the period of Construction, the Federal Government went in great length to ensure the execution of *proclaimation* specifications. With the image of an ex-slave telling stories to white children, it overlooked the social realities ex-slaves were experiencing.

### Names

Are names important? How?

- African titles: *n'gunza*, *n'ganga*.
- Islamic names: *Fatima*, *Aisha*, *Bilali*.
- Asante day-names: *Quashey* (Sunday), *Cudjo* (Monday), *Cuffee* (Friday), etc. Simply changed to English versions.
- Other names - probably translated from African names: Welcome, Gift, Fortune, Hardtimes, Handful, etc.
- Satirical names (mostly by masters): Hercules, Adonis, Venus, Scipio, Gustavus Vassa (Swedish King who won a war of liberation).

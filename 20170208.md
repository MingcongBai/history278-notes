Primary Source Analysis
-----------------------

First hand accounts, those written by the person(s) in question, diaries, contracts, legal documents, pottery, photograph, etc. Note that the analyses of primary source are regarded as *secondary sources*.

The idea of the assignment is to find a newspaper article from an archive, and create a piece of analysis on the newspaper article - what happened? What is the significance? ...?

### Assignment expectactions

Your primary source analyses should be roughly *3-4 pages typed, double-spaced*. Though you do not have to follow the sequence of elements listed below, each primary source analysis should incorporate ALL of the following three elements.

Using the Burney Historical Newspaper archive, all students must:

- Search for an article related to the slave trade or the African diaspora. Be mindful that your search terms should accord with the terminology of the day, so you will need to substitute “negro” for “black,” “wench” for “woman,” “Gold Coast” for Ghana, etc. Other search terms might include “slave,” “runaway,” “rebellion,” “Jamaica,” “Quamina,” “Quashee,” “Coromantee,” “Eboe,” etc. *Be creative in your searches!*
- Upon settling on an article, you should use the details in the article—names, places, etc.—to expand your search. You might start by seeing if there are key words in the article that appear in OTHER articles in the Burney newspapers. Thus, you would search again in the newspapers, using only those secondary terms. Then, you could move on to other databases at your disposal, including google books, the slave trade data base, etc. For example, if you find an article about a shipboard slave revolt, you could look to the slave trade data base to see if you can find the ship. You could also look up pertinent details in google books to determine if others have written on your case.
- Your paper should provide a brief narrative description of your: search process, your findings, and the reasons you think your findings are important (see above guidelines under “Primary Source Analysis Assignments”).
- You should staple a photocopy of your newspaper article to the back of your 3-4 page paper.

### Grading Criterion

- The first and most basic element is an introductory section that provides a general overview of the assigned text. *What type of source is it and what does it contain? Who is the author? Under what conditions was the source written? When and where was it written?*
- The second element is a critical analysis of the text. *At minimum, this will explain the major personalities, events, and/or institutions mentioned in the text. A good analysis will include some critique of the document’s content. The best critiques will analyze the document’s use of language, its biases, and implied audience and describe how these factors relate to the overall significance of the source.*
- The third element involves *placing the source in its proper historical and historiographical contexts.* Here, you should explain how and why the text should be understood relative to other historical figures, trends, and events in history. As much as possible, you should also describe how the text fits into ongoing debates about specific problems in the study of diaspora history. You should be able to glean this information from class lectures and other assigned readings.

### In short

The analysis will contain the following components:

- Search process.
- Introduction (context, brief description).
- Critical analysis (interests, rationales... analyze with skepticism... in relation to the historical context).
- Historical or historiographical context (grand schemes, emotions to the slave trades, slave uprises, the abolishionist movements...).

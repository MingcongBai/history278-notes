Week 2: Slavery and Economy in Africa
-------------------------------------

Recall, the initial surge of slave export started with the skyrocketed demand for cheap, or free labor in the American plantations, following the initial sales to European countries. From then Kongo, to the Bight of Benin.

### Bight of Biafra

*Bight: a curve or recess in a coastline, river, or other geographical feature.*

Now south-eastern Nigeria. The region was known to be more decentralized, in which *Igbo* was the main group of population. This meant that there was little "arranged trades" as seen in Kongo, therefore, more kidnapping and "outlaw"-style slave sales was found in this region - even before the European slave trades - obviously, with the European's introduction to the slave trades in the region, with weapons and luxurious goods, the region further distablized. In turn, the demand for weapons (in means of self-defense against enslavement) and luxurious goods (persumably for the gathering of people) *grew with the growth of the slave market.*

### Bight of Benin

More formal kingdoms were found here, for its large scale slave trades, this became known as the *"Coast of Slavery"*. In the late 17th century, the Kingdom of *Ouidah* had close relation with France (like Kongo with Portuguese).

- In early 18th century, the Kingdom of *Allada* initiated a war against *Whydah* to gain control of the slave market via *Ouidah*.
- The Kingdom of *Dahomey* initiated a war in the 1730s for the same motive, and gained an axis-like control chain of the slave market.

In later wars against the Kingdom of *Oyo*, the original three kingdoms defeated, and consequently became serving nations for *Oyo* - a larger kingdom with powerful Calvary (soldiers on horsebacks).

Note that at this time, this region still maintained trades to the North, across the Sahara Desert - *with both goods and slaves.* It is argued that all these trades would not be possible without the Atlantic slave trades... And thus these kingdoms along the coast became dependent on these trades.

### Gold Coast

The *Asante* became an extremely powerful kingdom in the 18th century, mining gold and selling to the Portuguese (probably the initial motive for the Portuguese to arrive in Africa) - but not unlike the other coastal kingdoms, they started the capture of slaves - with their large wealth in gold and people. In turn, weapons and goods flooded into *Asante*. The economics in gold mining was maintained, but increasingly, slave trades became more prominent in this region.

### Senegambia, Windward Coast, Sierra Leone

Senegamiba is known to be the first place where slaves were captured by Portuguese in 1441 (for its shortest distance from Europe). The region also has significantly higher population density when compared to the other three regions. In the period of 1662 - 1713, when the demand for slave skyrocketed, less than 5% of slaves were contributed by this region.

*Quite puzzling...*

- The region *did not intent on trading with the Europeans, with higher demands in all general goods - and higher prices as well*. THey did not need them.
- Wide-spread Islamic faith in the region made most in the region "insiders" - in religious affiliation - thus large amount of population was *not subject to enslavement*.
- Resistances to the trades were often found in this part of coast (along with Windward Coast and Sierra Leone), far more resistance on ships leaving from Senegambia and the Windward Coast *(~25% of recorded ship rebellions were on ships leaving from this region)*.

The most powerful kingdom in the Senegamiba region was the Kingdom of *Wolof* (which is found further inland), kingdoms along the coastline were all contributors to this kingdom. With growing slavery and trades in the coastal kingdoms, less kingdoms paid their contributions to *Wolof* - effectively loosing power to the coastal kingdoms.

Note: most population in the Kingdom of *Wolof* was Islam, and used Arabic for reading and writing, but *Wolof* was the primary oral language - and has always been like that ever since.

### In a greater context

Economy narrowed in all these regions, centralizing around the slave market. The export trade to the Atlantic at the demand of European for slaves, resulted in increased instability and tension in the regions, and consequently, future warfares and enslavement.

Europeans *shaped* Africa by controlling their markets and politics, in the interest of the trades.

### Transformations

We will categorize the transformations as follows:

- Demographics
- Gender imbalance
- Wealth-in-people?

#### Demographics

We know by the records that 10 millions of Africans arrived in the Americas as slaves, at least another 10 millions were killed on the slave ships and in the process of enslavement. At least 50,000 were enslaved each year from the beginning of the 18th century to mid-19th century.

For example, the population around contemporary Angola was ~25,000,000 in population in the 18th century, it was expected to have ~50,000,000 by the beginning of 19th century. *In reality, the count was ~13,000,000 by that particular point in time.*

#### Gender imbalance

2/3 of slaves taken from Africa were men, resulting in a significant gender imbalance and further polygyny.

#### Wealth-in-people?

The lost in people (to slavery) and perhaps more importantly, the future generations (lost to slavery) resulted in great damage to economic growth and production capacity.

Certainly there were goods in import, but not much in the way of development materials. People, being the *prime form of economics*, this was detrimental - not so much to the slavery-controlling elites - but certainly disastrous to most of the "common" population.

### Questions

#### Were Africans forced to sell slaves to the Europeans?

This is a common conception in the trans-Atlantic slave trades. Africans did have the power to choose against the slave trades given all the demands by the Europeans. *Africans chose to sell slaves to the Europeans.*

#### Were Africans selling "their own people"?

No! Africans were selling those who they consider "outsiders", remember that there was no such thing as a "common identity" among Africans - they don't see themselves as "Africans", not yet.

#### Why did Africans sell slaves?

For goods brought in by the Europeans. Additionally, to a certain extent (or in another process), influences imposed in conjunction by the Europeans to bring warfare - and with warfare, captives and the defeated became subject to enslavement - with excess in slaves, Africans had the freedom to sell the slaves to the Europeans for goods.

#### What were the impacts of the Atlantic slave trade on African societies?

African societies, especially their economies became centralized around slavery. The ways of money making (so to speak) narrowed, and in some extreme cases, became solely for slaves. With such tightening of economics, unstability was brought in to slave-trading regions - and warfare frequently broke out, bringing more captives for enslavement.

Also note mentioning is the import of weapons, in short periods of time, this could have damaged the balance between the powers of kingdoms (although there wasn't much to begin with) - political injustice became a more prominent factor in African politics between kingdoms.

Demographics and ideologies shifted in these areas. As most sold to Europeans were men, polygyny became more commonly found, and lack of reproduction capacity as a result brought slow down to economy growth - or even damages, and cases of decreasing population. Ideologies about wealth-in-people also shifted, if not completely, to a more individualized nature, where wealth in material goods became more prominent in social hierarchies.

#### Did the Atlantic slave trade transform African forms of slavery? How?

The Atlantic slave trade certainly had transformed African forms of slavery. From the traditional idea of enslavement of "outsiders", to enslavement (for "outsiders") for trades and goods.

There was a shift in motives and methodologies. Not only did Africans start to see enslavement as a business, methodologies shifted along with the changes:

- Those regulated between kingdoms of Africa and European nations, slavery became a sort of "formal" industry in Africa.
- Those non-regulated resulted in slave raids: kidnapping and robbery (of wealth and people).

#### Did the Atlantic slave trade transform African societies and economics? How? Why?

Thinking about the trades, this probably have brought in a more vertical form of social hierarchies based on material goods and of course, people...
